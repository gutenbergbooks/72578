<h2  id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>BLASTING FIRE</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Entering</span> Tom Swift’s private laboratory
from a room farther down the hall, Ned Newton,
who seemed somewhat out of breath, glanced at
the young inventor and asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you seem to be getting anywhere with it,
Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment there was no reply. Tom, who
had been leaning over a complicated apparatus
of wires, switches, and radio bulbs that glowed
dimly, was slowly turning a dial. Ned repeated
his question, adding:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What seems to be the trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trouble?” queried Tom, looking at Ned with
eyes, however, that did not see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There must be some trouble,” insisted Ned,
“or you’d have been capering around here on
one leg when I came in after doing my stuff back
there,” and he nodded toward the room farther
down the hall. “How about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift glanced away from the apparatus,
which very much resembled a radio receiving set,
to a yard-square burnished sheet of metal hanging
in front of him and connected to the other
mechanism by several wires. This burnished
sheet appeared to be made of a mirror of some
metal with a square of heavy plate glass covering
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you answer?” inquired Ned, with a
chuckle. “Boy, I certainly did some acting back
there all by myself! And I’d like to know
whether I got it through to you. Did I? Bet
I did that song and dance for the fiftieth time
just now. Come on—wake up—did it come
through? What’s the matter, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I’m thinking,” said Tom slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t need an interpreter to tell me that!”
and again Ned chuckled. “I can see it with half
an eye. But was it a success?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and no,” replied Tom, turning a switch
which seemed to cut off some electrical current,
for at once a faint hum that had been audible in
the laboratory ceased. “Yes, and no. It came
through all right; that is, part of it did, but the
rest——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom ceased speaking and bent over his apparatus.
He adjusted some set screws, turned a
couple of dials, and changed three of the radio
tubes which, now that the power was cut off, no
longer glowed with light beneath the quicksilver
coatings on the thin glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me to go back there and do it
over?” asked Ned. “I’m willing, if you say so,”
and he started for the room he had just left—a
room wherein, under the focused rays of a
battery of powerful lights and close to a box
containing a strange assortment of tubes and
transmitters, Ned had done his “stunt,” which
consisted of singing and dancing about on a
small stage. He performed alone—there was no
audience but the distant one of Tom Swift in his
laboratory several hundred feet away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute, Ned!” Tom Swift called
sharply, when his chum, who was also the financial
manager of the Swift Construction Company,
was about to leave the room. “I guess we
might as well call it a day’s work and quit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A night’s work, you mean!” retorted Ned,
pointing to the window which reflected the darkness
outside. “Must be past twelve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess it is,” admitted the young inventor,
somewhat wearily. “I didn’t notice. It’s a
shame to keep you at it so long, Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t mind!” said the other quickly.
“Not as long as it’s going to be a success. But
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift hesitated, looked at the complicated
machine in front of him and slowly shook
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frankly, Ned, I can’t say,” he admitted.
“You came through in a measure. Of course I
heard you plainly enough over the radio—that
part is simple enough. But the picture of you
was too shadowy to be satisfactory. It’s coming,
though. I’ll make it come!” and Tom, in
spite of his weariness, showed some fighting
spirit in his voice and manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you identify me there?” and Ned
pointed to that burnished metal mirror with its
covering of glass in the lower edge of which were
fused several wires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I knew it was you, Ned, of course.
But, as I say, the projected picture was too
visionary. It didn’t stand out clearly and with
depth the way I want it to. It was like a moving
picture when the man up in the booth goes to
sleep on the job and the projector gets out of
focus. I’m rather disappointed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind going back and going through
my stunt again, even for the fifty-first performance,”
offered Ned, with enthusiasm. “I don’t
care how late it is. Helen won’t expect me
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you have an engagement?” asked Tom,
looking sharply at his friend. “And I kept you
here doing a song and dance act half the night
when Helen expected you! That’s too bad! If
I’d known——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your hair on!” chuckled Ned. “I
didn’t <i>really</i> have a date with Helen. I said I
might drop around if there wasn’t anything to
do here. But she knows you well enough to
make allowances for emergency work—and this
was just that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is an emergency all right,” returned
Tom slowly. “But I shall give it up for the
night. No use keeping you any longer, Ned.
Go on home and I’ll try it again to-morrow with
a different wave length. I think that’s where
the difficulty is. We’ll tackle it again in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” assented Ned Newton, and he
could not keep out of his voice a little note of
satisfaction and relief. Truth to tell, he was
a bit tired. For several weeks now he had been
helping Tom Swift on the latter’s newest idea—an
invention, Tom declared, that would be the
greatest on record and one that would tend to
revolutionize the radio and moving picture industries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a daring plan Tom had conceived of
making a radio machine, both sending and receiving,
that would enable a person or any number
of persons not only to hear a distant performance
in their own home, but also see those
taking part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll make it possible,” declared Tom Swift,
“for a man to sit in his easy chair, smoking a
cigar in his library, and, by a turn of a switch,
not only to hear the latest opera but also to see
each and every performer and witness the whole
play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ned had asked how the vision would
appear to the man, Tom had replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On an electrified screen attached to his radio
receiver by which he listens to the songs and
music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tom said, the problem of transmitting an
entire opera through the air was simple enough.
That had been done many times. So had the
transmitting of photographs by wireless. Also,
in a limited way, television had made it possible
for a person in a dark room to be visible to
lookers-on in another apartment some distance
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am going to combine the two!” declared
Tom Swift. “I want to make it possible
for a synchronized performance of seeing and
hearing to take place. Thus when a theater is
equipped with my sending apparatus and I have
perfected my receiver, one need never go outside
the house to enjoy a theatrical performance or a
concert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But even if you’re successful, you won’t make
any money out of it,” declared Ned Newton,
after first hearing of his chum’s ambitions.
“Look at the radio people! The air is free.
Anybody who wants to can tune in and listen to
a million dollar concert without paying a cent.
They don’t even have to buy any special kind of
receiver—they can roll their own, so to speak.
What’s to prevent them from stealing your stuff—your—what
do you call it, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t settled on a name,” Tom said, with
a smile. “Call it talking pictures for the time
being. Of course it’s entirely different from
moving pictures with phonograph attachment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what’s to prevent any one from tuning
in on your talking pictures?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” answered Tom, pointing to a small
tube on one side of the receiving apparatus.
“This is a new device. Without it no one can
see and hear my pictures that will talk. This is
protected by patents and no one can use it without
my sanction. That’s the secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe you’ve got something there,”
Ned admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, during the past months, he had helped
Tom Swift bring the new apparatus to such perfection
as it now had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present night’s performance was only one
of many. At first there had been only blank
failure. But by using different kinds of receiving
screens, finally settling on a mirror covered
with electrified glass, Tom had achieved a measure
of success. Still, even now, the projected
image of the singing or talking performer in a
distant room was too dim to be commercially
successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go at it again to-morrow,” Tom told
his chum as he let him out of the laboratory and
locked the door after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the biggest thing I ever attempted,” he
said to himself, when Ned had gone and he was
alone in the room, “the very biggest, and I’m
not going to have it stolen from me. No one
suspects as yet what I am working on—no one
except dad and Ned. But I wish I were nearer
success. I thought the image would come
through clear to-night, but there was that same
haze—that same haze. I wonder——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused and listened intently. Outside his
door he heard footsteps—cautious footsteps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that you, Ned?” he called. “Anything
wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom did not open the door—he was taking no
chances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you, Ned?” he asked again, more
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mr. Swift,” came back a voice with a
foreign accent. “I am just leaving my own
laboratory. I think I have perfected that new
magnetic gear shift we have been working on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good,” Tom responded. He recognized
the voice of Jacob Greenbaum, a clever
inventor whom he had recently engaged to work
on some side lines that occupied the Swift factory.
Tom had an idea for a new device to
make easier the shifting of gears on automobiles.
It was an adaptation of the old magnetic selection
that has often been tried and which, up to
date, had not been successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to take a look at it?” asked
Greenbaum, and from the nearness of the voice
Tom knew that the man was just outside the
locked door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you, Greenbaum, not now,” the
young inventor replied. “I am busy at something
else. I’ll see you in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are working late, Mr. Swift,” went on
the man. “Could I be of any service to you?
I should be glad——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you,” Tom said. “As for lateness,
you are doing a bit of overtime yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes; but I do not mind. I think I am on
the right track. If you would take a look——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not now,” and Tom’s voice was a bit
sharp. “I am busy. Good night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no response for a moment, and then
came a short:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Greenbaum, however, did not immediately
move away from the door and a look of annoyance
passed over Tom’s face as he bent over his
secret apparatus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s he hanging around for?” thought
Tom. “I wonder if he can be a spy? Two or
three times I’ve caught him lurking around my
private laboratory. But he can’t get in since I
put on the new lock, and I know he hasn’t so
much as poked his nose in during the times I
have been here experimenting. Still, I wonder——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about to call out, to tell the man to go
away when footsteps were heard moving down
the corridor and toward the outer door of the
small shop where most of the experimental work
was carried on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good riddance,” murmured Tom Swift. “I
don’t want to be unjust to a good workman, and
Greenbaum is all of that, but I must confess I
don’t like the way he hangs around me. As
soon as he finishes that magnetic gear shift I’ll
pay him well and let him go. Now let’s see if I
can think up another way of doing this. Perhaps
if I hooked up the wave distributor to the
vibratory selector instead of to the polarizer
we’d get better vision. I’ll try that and have
Ned perform again to-morrow. Now I’ll take a
look to see that my wire connections are all right
and then I think I’ll go to bed. I’m tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom spent perhaps another half hour in getting
things in readiness for some new experiments,
and, having made sure that everything
connected with his secret was put out of sight of
possible prying eyes, the young inventor started
toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He inspected the new combination lock he had
had put on, noting that it was properly set, and
then opened the door to step out. The experimental
laboratory was only a short walk from
Tom’s home, the back of the Swift Construction
plant being some distance away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tom opened the door there was a click, followed
at once by a blinding flash of blasting fire.
Then a dull explosion shook the building. Tom
had no chance to leap back. The force of the
blast hurled him forward, across the corridor
and out through a wire-screened window into the
yard. He fell heavily, uttered an inarticulate
cry, and then seemed to be sinking down into a
pit of dense blackness.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>NED DISAPPEARS</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Scarcely</span> had the echoes of the explosion in
Tom Swift’s laboratory died away, being swallowed
up in the blackness and silence of the
night, than members of the Swift household began
stirring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swift, Tom’s aged and rather infirm father,
sat up in bed and called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that? Thunder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Massa Swift,” answered Eradicate, the
faithful colored servant, who, now that Mr.
Swift had declined so, was his personal attendant,
sleeping in the next room. “No, Massa
Swift,” he repeated. “Dat wa’n’t no thunder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Eradicate was moving about and
fumbling for a light. Mr. Swift, however, had
reached up and switched on the reading lamp attached
to the head of his bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it then?” asked the aged inventor,
for Mr. Swift had begun invention work when
Tom was a mere baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I spects, Massa, dat it was somethin’ Tom
been doin’ out in his lab’tory,” the colored man
answered. He had his own light on now and
was beginning to dress, preparatory to making
an investigation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Tom was in the midst of anything that
made a noise like that he must be hurt!” declared
Mr. Swift. “That was a sharp explosion.
Hurry, Rad, and see what it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sah, Massa Swift, I’s a-hurryin’!” answered
Eradicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a room farther down the hall in the
Swift home came a deep, heavy voice exclaiming:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire! Fire! Koku see much blaze!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku was a gigantic specimen of a man whom
Tom had brought back with him from an airship
trip to a distant, mysterious land. The
giant was rather simple, and never seemed to be
able to master the English language. But he
was a faithful servant and, because of his enormous
strength, Tom frequently used Koku as a
guard about the plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire?” cried Mr. Swift, fumbling for his
clothes. “Is there a fire, Koku?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much blaze in Master Tom’s workshop,” the
giant replied. He could not twist his tongue
around “laboratory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dey suah is a fire!” cried Eradicate, running
to his window. “By golly, whole place looks
like it was burnin’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper,
several other servants, and Garret Jackson, the
shop manager and superintendent, who was
spending the night at the Swift home, had been
aroused. Several workmen in the Swift plant,
who lived not far from the experimental laboratory,
had also been aroused by the explosion and
the glare of flames and were now running to
help, adding their voices to the others giving the
alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Mr. Swift, with Eradicate and
Koku, had descended to the yard that was between
the laboratory and the house, and by the
glare of the flames Tom’s inert body was seen
stretched out on the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eradicate and Koku bent over the body of the
young inventor. Koku felt for the heart and
found it beating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master Tom no dead,” said the giant simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then carry him into the house, and send for
a doctor at once,” directed Mr. Swift. “Oh,
what could have happened? The whole place
will go up in flames and Tom’s valuable new invention
will be destroyed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat fire’ll soon be out!” predicted Eradicate,
and Koku, lifting Tom like a child, started toward
the house with him. “Fire not so bad,
after all, Massa Swift!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the injured inventor is being ministered
to I shall take a brief moment to acquaint new
readers with, a few facts regarding Tom Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a young man, well set up physically,
and in spite of the fact that he was young, had
to his credit many important inventions, not
a few of which had been adopted by the United
States Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom’s mother was dead, but he and his father,
were well looked after by Mrs. Baggert, the
housekeeper. As related in the first volume of
this series, entitled “Tom Swift and His Motorcycle,”
the youth began his inventive activities
early. Wakefield Damon, who lived in the
neighboring town of Waterfield, had, some years
before this present story opens, bought a motorcycle.
Not knowing much about such machines,
Mr. Damon soon found himself climbing
a tree near Tom’s home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom rescued the eccentric individual and,
“blessing” many animate and inanimate objects
from his rubber boots to his collar button, Mr.
Damon declared he was through with motorcycles.
Tom bought the damaged machine, repaired
and improved it and had several thrilling
adventures on it. From then on his inventions
followed one another and they were not yet
ended. In the volume immediately preceding
this and named “Tom Swift Circling the Globe,”
you may read of the further doings of the young
inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had many friends and not a few enemies,
the latter chiefly unscrupulous men who had
tried to steal his inventions but who had been
worsted by Tom, with the aid of Mr. Damon,
Ned Newton, Eradicate and Koku.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom always insisted that Mary Nestor, a
beautiful girl to whom the young inventor was
practically engaged, had a lot to do with his
success, but Mary always smiled tolerantly when
her friend said this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do I do, Tom?” she would ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You give me inspiration,” he would answer,
“and that, to an inventor, is the one thing
needed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether Mary Nestor was the inspiration for
Tom’s latest talking-picture invention does not
matter, but the fact remains that Tom was in
the midst of perfecting that machine when the
explosion occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the fire was being brought under control
by several of the shop men, under the direction
of Mr. Jackson, the young inventor was
hurriedly carried into his home and laid on a
bed. Mrs. Baggert, sensing that medical aid
might be needed, had, almost as soon as she got
up after the alarm, telephoned for the nearest
doctor. So it was not long after the explosion
before Tom was in the care of the medical
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he badly hurt?” asked Mr. Swift, anxiously
hovering around the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think not,” was the cheerful reply of Dr.
Layton. “He has had a shock and is suffering
more from that than from actual injuries,
though he is cut and bruised and has some nasty
burns. But we will soon make him comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is still unconscious, though, isn’t he?”
asked Mr. Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Dr. Layton admitted. “But that is
nothing to worry about. Nature will take care
of that. It is better to let his senses come back
gradually rather than to give some strong stimulant
that will shock him into wakefulness and
perhaps do more harm than good. I’ll make
him as comfortable as I can and we’ll just wait
for him to rouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The burns and cuts were dressed, Koku being
of great service because he could lift and move
Tom as if the young man were a baby. Yet
Tom was of husky build, strong and muscular.
The giant made an ideal nurse in a case like
this, though Eradicate, who had a deep love for
Tom Swift, fluttered eagerly about, anxious to
do something to help. Mrs. Baggert had him
bring hot water and bandages, and this gave
Eradicate as much pleasure as Koku found in
ministering more personally to his young master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the first alarm over Tom’s condition
was over and when it was apparent that there
was no immediate danger, Mr. Swift went out to
see what damage had been done and if there
was any further danger from the fire and explosion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flames, by this time, were subdued.
There had been a second but slight, explosion.
This, however, did little damage, as the force
of it was directed toward the outer corridor, part
of the wall of which was blown away. The
greatest force of the first explosion, likewise, had
been in the same direction, and though the door
of Tom’s private laboratory had been stove in
and some of his valuable apparatus scattered
about and burned, fortunately no great damage
was done to the secret room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ascertaining this and knowing how jealously
Tom guarded the new secret, Mr. Swift had
some of the men nail the laboratory up, an improvised
door being made and boards being fastened
over the shattered windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had been blown through a window in the
corridor outside his laboratory. But, luckily,
the window was up at the bottom, and Tom had
shot through a wire mosquito screen instead of
through the glass. In spite of this, and the fact
that he had landed in a clump of deep, thick
grass, the young inventor had not come off
scatheless from the accident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things aren’t as bad as they seemed at first,
Mr. Swift,” reported Mr. Jackson a few hours
after the explosion. “The fire is all out now
and Tom’s things don’t seem to be much damaged.
I’ve got several men on guard. They’ll
stay there the rest of the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will soon be morning,” murmured the old
gentleman. “Thank you, Jackson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder how much longer Tom will remain
unconscious?” Mr. Swift said, entering the sickroom
and glancing toward the bed on which his
son lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he is coming around now,” said the
doctor softly, as he moved to his patient’s side.
“Yes, he is coming out of it,” he added. “How
do you feel?” he asked as Tom opened his eyes
and stared about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty—pretty—rocky,” was the husky answer.
“What—what happened?” he asked in a
stronger voice. Then, as recollection came back
to him, Tom went on: “I remember now.
There was an explosion just as I was coming out
of my laboratory. Is it gone? Is everything
gone?” and he tried to get up. Dr. Layton
pushed him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now lie still,” said the doctor. “Things
aren’t half as bad as you think, and you’re not
much hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care about myself!” declared Tom
fiercely. “But if that new—that machine is
blown up—” He looked anxiously at his father,
the only other person in the room who knew
about the secret of the talking-picture invention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, Tom,” the aged inventor made
haste to say. “The door and windows of your
laboratory were blown out and some of your apparatus
damaged by the fire and explosion.
But your—the main object is all right,” he finished,
and Tom understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Tom could ask any more questions,
Dr. Layton administered a sedative to quiet his
patient’s nerves, and, after a few more questions
had been answered to the satisfaction of the
young inventor, he sank back into a sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not before, however, he had told his father
and the others that he had no idea what had
caused the explosion and fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it an electrical blast?” Mr. Swift wanted
to know. He was aware that often a high tension
current may act almost like a blast of
dynamite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think not,” Tom had said. “I examined
my wires the last thing, after Greenbaum had
left the building, and they were all right. The
explosion seemed to be coincident with my opening
of the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It were a bomb! Dat’s whut it were—a
bomb!” declared Eradicate. “An’ ef I kotches
de feller whut done planted it I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do now, Rad,” whispered Mrs.
Baggert. “Tom must be kept quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The injured young inventor was now sleeping
quietly, and Dr. Layton said he would remain
until morning to see how Tom was when he
awakened again. Then, the fire being out and
no more danger appearing, the house became
quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Swift had a worried, anxious air. He
could not account for that explosion. Some
more of Tom’s enemies must be at work, was the
conclusion of the aged inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was rising and Tom was just awakening
again when the telephone rang. Mrs. Baggert,
answering it, brought word that Mary
Nestor was on the wire and wanted to know how
badly Tom was hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’d she hear about it?” Tom demanded
when he was prevented from answering the call
in person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it seems,” reported the housekeeper,
“that the town fire-department responded to the
alarm. However, they weren’t needed, as your
own men put out the blaze, Mr. Swift. However,
it was rumored that you were hurt and
Mary heard of it. What shall I tell her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her I’m all right and that I’ll be over as
soon as I can get dressed,” Tom answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No you won’t!” chuckled Dr. Layton.
“You’re not badly hurt, but I’m taking no
chances with you and you’ll stay in bed all day.
Miss Nestor can call here if she likes,” he conceded,
with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks for that favor,” and Tom smiled in
answer. “Tell her, please, Mrs. Baggert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” and the housekeeper hurried back to
the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A further inspection of Tom’s injuries by daylight
did not reveal them as any worse than the
first diagnosis indicated and Dr. Layton said
that his patient would be up and about in a few
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when I am things are going to hum!”
declared Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had finished a light breakfast and the
medical man was preparing to depart when the
telephone rang again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that’s Mary I’m going to speak to her!”
exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it isn’t,” said Mrs. Baggert, with a smile,
coming in from the hall outside Tom’s room, the
telephone being installed in a booth in the corridor.
“It’s Mr. Newton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned?” exclaimed Tom Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not Ned—his father,” replied the housekeeper.
“He wants to know when Ned will be
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Ned will be home!” exclaimed Tom, in
bewildered surprise. “Why, I thought he was
at home now. He left me before midnight to go
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He isn’t there,” said Mrs. Baggert. “Mr.
Newton says Ned hasn’t been home all night and
he thought he must be here, as he often stays
all night, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know,” admitted Tom, with a puzzled
look on his face. “But he didn’t stay last night.
He started for home. He was dead tired from
helping me. Ask Mr. Newton if he is sure Ned
isn’t sleeping soundly in his own room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Baggert went back to the telephone. In
a few moments she came back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned seems to have disappeared,” she announced.
“He didn’t come home or send any
word. Mr. Newton is quite worried. He wants
to talk to you.”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>SUSPICIONS</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span> looked at Dr. Layton. The
medical man had paused in his departure on
hearing the telephone bell and the ensuing talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor,” began Tom, “I don’t want to disobey
your advice, but I’ve simply got to talk to
Ned’s father. Something may have happened.
I’m beginning to get worried. There may be
more at the bottom of this than just an accidental
explosion in my laboratory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather you stayed in bed,” said the physician.
“You oughtn’t to move around so soon
after such a shock. Can’t you move the telephone
in here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get an extension wire that I have in my
room and plug it in,” offered Mr. Swift, and
while Mrs. Baggert was telling Mr. Newton that
Tom would soon speak to him, Mr. Swift, with
the help of Eradicate, quickly had an extension
telephone rigged up at Tom’s bedside. Then
the young inventor talked to the father of his
business manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure, Mr. Newton, that Ned isn’t in
the house, sleeping his head off?” was Tom’s
first question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he isn’t here,” was the worried answer.
“When he didn’t come down to breakfast we
didn’t think anything of it at first, as he was going
to be at your place late, he said, and we
wanted to let him get as much rest as he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when we looked into his room a little
while ago to see how he was sleeping, he wasn’t
there. His mother said that she hadn’t heard
him come in during the night, but even then we
weren’t alarmed. We thought he had spent the
night with you, as he so often does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Tom said slowly, “Ned isn’t here. He
left my laboratory somewhere around midnight
and I thought he was going straight home. But
wait a minute!” Tom exclaimed as a new idea
came to him. “I just happened to think. He
might have gone to see Miss Morton and have
stayed there all night, being too tired to pull
up and head for home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned Newton was engaged to Miss Morton
and, more than once after calling there and finding
himself stormbound, he had been persuaded
by her parents to remain over night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’ll find him there,” suggested
Tom, though in his heart he remembered that
Ned had said it was too late to go to see Helen.
Besides, he had had no positive engagement
with her. “Call up the Mortons,” was Tom’s
final suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” agreed Mr. Newton. “Thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had no sooner finished his breakfast, following
the departure of Dr. Layton, than the extension
telephone rang again, and once more Mr.
Newton was on the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned wasn’t at Helen’s,” the father of the
mysteriously missing young man reported.
“Oh, Tom, what do you think could have happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young inventor was at a loss for an answer.
Rapidly he reviewed the situation in his
mind. Ned had left the laboratory, he was sure
of that—or, wait a moment, was he? He had
not seen Ned go out, but had taken it for granted
that such had occurred. Then Tom had puzzled
a bit over his latest invention before starting
for his house. Then had come the explosion
and——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps Ned had not left the laboratory. He
may have gone to one of the private rooms and
turned in there. Tom kept two bedrooms in
this building for the use of himself and his manager
when they were working late at night and
did not want to disturb the main household.
That might be it. Ned might be asleep in the
laboratory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a few minutes, Mr. Newton,” Tom advised
over the wire. “I have just thought of
something. It is barely possible that Ned
didn’t start for home after all last night. He
isn’t at our house, but he may be in the laboratory.
I’ll send out and have a search made.
I’ll call you up in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Tom. But what’s this I’ve heard
about a fire at your place last night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there was a little blaze—it didn’t amount
to anything,” was the reply. Tom said nothing
about the explosion. He wanted to minimize
the damage, and he believed what had been told
him, that it really did not amount to much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Koku,” he called to the giant, “you and Rad
hurry out to my laboratory and look for Mr.
Newton. He may be in one of the bedrooms,
asleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Asleep, Tom, after that explosion?” exclaimed
Mr. Swift incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The telephone receiver had been hung back
on the hook, so Mr. Newton heard none of this
talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem possible,” Tom had to admit
to his father; “but still I can’t account for
Ned’s disappearance in any other way. He was
dead tired and he may have slept through the
fire and explosion. We’ll soon find out. I wish
I could go and take a look for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you stay here!” his father ordered.
“Obey the doctor’s advice. Koku and Rad will
find Ned if he’s to be found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant and negro came back soon, to report
that there was no sign of Ned in the laboratory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he may have returned home by
this time,” suggested Mr. Swift. “Better call
up and find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is just a bare possibility—” said Tom
musingly, as he reached for the ’phone, “there is
just a bare chance that Ned took the midnight
train for New York to get the selenium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Took the midnight train to get selenium!”
exclaimed Mr. Swift. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I needed some more sensitive selenium
for my—for my—new experiment,” Tom said,
knowing his father would understand he was
speaking of the talking-picture machine. “Ned
knew about it and planned to go after it to-day.
When he left me last night he may have decided
suddenly to keep right on to New York. I think
I’ll tell his father that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you really believe it, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Dad, I don’t. But I don’t want Mr.
Newton to give up hope until I can get on the
job myself and help hunt for Ned. Even at
that there is a bare chance he did go to New
York. I’ll suggest that to his father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Newton received this ray of hope gratefully
and Tom was glad he had thought of it,
though he knew it was only a shadow. If Ned
really had taken the midnight train, which was
possible, there ought to come a message from
him soon reporting on the selenium matter.
Also, Ned, being a home-loving young man,
would naturally be expected to send word to his
family about his return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will only hold matters back for a short
time at best,” said Tom to his father. “But
I didn’t imagine my laboratory was burned
enough to destroy the bedrooms. Do you think
there is much more damage, Jackson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to your laboratory,” was the reassuring
reply. “You see, after the explosion the flames
shot up at the back before we knew it, and the
draft sucked them in through the bedroom windows.
So the upper part of the place was worse
burned than the lower. But Ned Newton was
not in there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad of that,” Tom said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was beginning to feel the strain of what he
had gone through, and he was glad when, a little
later, Mary Nestor and her father motored
over to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Nestor had some time before taken a long
trip North for his health, a trip that had greatly
improved his condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, what happened?” exclaimed Mary
when she saw him in bed, all bandaged up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’d like to know,” he answered,
with a smile. “It was like a premature Fourth
of July celebration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you much hurt?” the girl faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing more than shock and scratches,”
Tom answered. “I’ll be up and around in another
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it was three days before Dr. Layton
would allow Tom to get out of bed. Meanwhile
nothing had been heard from Ned Newton. He
had not gone to New York, that was evident, unless
something had happened to him there, and
he was not around Shopton, the town on Lake
Carlopa where the Swifts’ large plant was
located.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s mighty queer,” said the worried Mr.
Newton, when Tom was forced to admit that his
New York theory was useless. “Where could
he be keeping himself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t imagine,” Tom said. He was much
broken up over the disappearance of his chum.
He knew Ned well enough to know that he was
not staying away from choice, though Tom did
not communicate his suspicions to Mr. Newton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as Tom was able, he went out to the
laboratory. The scene of ruin on the lower floor
was not so bad as he had feared, but the back
and upper part of the laboratory was pretty well
burned away. Then Tom had the improvised
nailed-up door removed so he might enter the
room where he had set up his talking-picture
machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it’s all right,” the young inventor
murmured as he approached the apparatus.
“They said it was, after the fire and explosion,
but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a cry of dismay as he saw that,
though the main part of the marvelous new machine
was intact, the force of the explosion had
wrecked the delicate mechanism that he depended
on to prevent any but authorized owners
of the apparatus from using it. Tom’s secret
invention was badly damaged. In addition, all
the new radio tubes, of a kind never before used,
had been shattered by the blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This sure is tough luck!” murmured Tom
Swift. “This knocks me out! The fire wasn’t
so bad, but the explosion—whew! This certainly
is tough! But I’ll work double time and
soon have it in shape again, and better than
ever. Luckily, I have duplicate parts of that
secret check apparatus, and I can get new tubes,
though it will take time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better go slow, Tom,” advised his
father, who had come into the partly wrecked
private room with his son. “First thing you
know, you’ll blow yourself to pieces with these
experiments of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was no experiment of mine, Dad, that
caused the explosion here!” said Tom decidedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. All my wires were in good shape. It
was some outside force that did the damage. I
believe some one planted an infernal machine in
here, Dad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do, Tom? Whom do you suspect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I hardly know what to say,” was the slow
answer. “But I have one man in mind.
Where’s Clark?” he asked suddenly, naming a
young workman who was much in Tom’s confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send him to you,” Mr. Swift offered.
“What’s the matter, Tom? What are you going
to have Clark do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some detective work,” was the low answer.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE MESSAGE</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span> sank wearily into a chair, facing
his damaged talking-picture machine. That it
was very seriously damaged was plainer to the
eyes of the young inventor than to those even of
his father, who was one of three persons aware
of what great changes the new machine was
destined to bring about. But Tom rallied and
from the ruins of his invention saw mentally,
rising like the fabled Phoenix from its own ashes,
a new and better piece of apparatus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe, after all,” mused Tom, “this will
turn out better than it looked at first sight. I already
have an idea for some improvements in
the new machine I’m going to start—as soon as
I’m able,” he added somewhat grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom, you’d better go back to bed!” exclaimed
his father anxiously. “You know Dr.
Layton said——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m all right!” protested the young inventor.
“I’m going slow. I do feel a bit pulled
out, but I don’t intend to do any work. However,
I’m on the track of something, and it’s got
to be followed up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you think this was deliberately done,
Tom?” asked Mr. Swift as he finished sending a
message to have Jim Clark sent to Tom’s private
quarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m almost positive of it,” was the reply.
“And I have under suspicion a certain man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?” asked Mr. Swift in a low voice, making
sure no one was near the shattered door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Greenbaum,” was the equally low answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I thought he was one of your best
workers, Tom!” exclaimed Mr. Swift in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he is, in his own particular line. But now
that I think matters over, I see that there is a
chance he had something to do with this explosion.
He was here in the laboratory just before
it happened. He and I and Ned Newton
were the only ones here, as a matter of fact.
Ned has disappeared, and that’s worrying me,
but I’ll come to that feature in due time. I
guess Ned can look after himself, though his disappearance
is certainly mysterious, coupled with
everything else that’s happened. But when I
stop to think about Greenbaum being here just
before the explosion——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Tom,” interrupted his father, “I
thought you said Greenbaum went before you
locked up and came home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Apparently he did. But he may have come
back. That’s what I want Clark to do—a bit
of detective work to find out if Greenbaum went
to his boarding house and stayed there. If he
did——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entrance, at that moment, of the young
workman in whom Tom placed much confidence
brought a sudden end to the talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sent for me, Mr. Swift?” asked Clark,
with a smile. “Is it about the new negative
gravity machine I’m working on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not this time, Clark,” answered Tom, motioning
the young fellow to take a chair near
the scorched desk which was not far from the
shattered talking-picture machine. That apparatus
had, however, been covered from prying
eyes. “I want you to do a bit of detective
work, if you will,” went on the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without telling just why he wanted the information,
Tom instructed his agent to find out in
secret something about Greenbaum, seeking to
learn just what the man did on the night of the
explosion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I get you!” exclaimed Clark, with ready wit.
“I’m wise all right. I’ll shadow him if you want
me to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t dog him,” objected Tom. “Just
trace his movements. You can tell your foreman
you’re working for me and it will be all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Clark dispatched on this mission, Tom
took from the partial wreck of his new apparatus
such pieces as were vital for rebuilding it
and then, asking his father to have the laboratory
cleaned up and put in working shape again,
Tom went back to his bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truth to tell, he was pretty well fagged out,
not so much physically as mentally. The shock
both to his hopes and his body, as well as worry
over Ned’s disappearance, was beginning to tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t you better give this up, Tom?” asked
his father as, having set men to putting the laboratory
to rights, he went to his son’s room
where he found Tom stretched out on a long
sofa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give what up, Dad? You mean trying to
find out who blew me up and why Ned is missing?
Give those problems up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I mean work on this new talking-picture
machine of yours. I don’t believe it will ever
work, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it has worked, Dad!” exclaimed the
young man, with enthusiasm. “Only about an
hour before Ned left and the explosion happened,
I got a pretty fine record of what Ned did in the
theater room,” for so Tom called the apartment
with its battery of bright lights where the young
manager had sung and danced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You heard Ned’s voice?” asked Mr. Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly,” declared Tom. “Saw him, too.
But the vision was not as clear as it’s got to be
to make this a commercial success. But I know
how to improve it, and I’m going to. I can’t
give that up, Dad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might be better if you did, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better? How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for your own safety. You’re using
powerful electrical currents and you’ve had one
explosion already; so——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But didn’t I tell you, Dad,” and Tom smiled
tolerantly, “that this explosion was none of my
doing? Nothing went wrong with the wires.
They were all in shape and I was just opening
the door when something went off. It was something
that was set, too—a bomb, if I guess
aright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the more reason for giving it up, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Dad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean that perhaps some one, or perhaps
a number of persons, don’t want this new invention
to succeed. Think what it will mean to
the moving picture industry if you can give
people in their own homes entertainment such
as the big theaters present. And where will the
theaters come out if their high-priced shows can
be picked up by every one who buys one of your
machines?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s their lookout,” said Tom. “It was
said that the radio would kill the phonograph;
and it nearly did, but the phonograph folks
came back strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is different, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know it is—different and better. No,
I’m not going to back out, bombs or no bombs!
Besides, Dad, you must realize that we are in
this thing pretty deep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deep, Tom? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean we have a large amount of money
tied up in this thing—more than I like to think
about. I’ve just got to come through with it
to break even.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tom, I suppose you know best,” said
the aged inventor, with rather a weary smile.
“But be careful of yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mrs. Baggert had put new bandages on
some of Tom’s burns and he had taken a little
rest, he called up Ned’s home, only to learn that
no word had come from him. His parents were
greatly worried, for Ned was not selfish and
was not the kind of young man to remain long
away from home without sending word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may have decided to take a little unannounced
vacation,” Tom told Mr. Newton, “and
have gone to the country. He may have sent
word and the letter or the message has failed to
arrive. Shall I notify the police?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not yet,” decided Mr. Newton. “Ned
may be all right and he’d hate any police notoriety.
We’ll wait a few days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The few days that followed were anxious ones,
not only for Ned’s parents, but also for Tom
Swift. He had a double worry, divided between
the disappearance of his trusted chum and manager
and concern over the wreck of his new apparatus.
The latter worry was more easily disposed
of, however, though it meant hard work
and delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom set some of his most trusted men at the
labor of reconstructing the new apparatus, but
in such a way that the secret could not be come
at. Only certain unimportant parts were given
out, and Tom and his father would make the
more vital sections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since Tom already had on the market a telephoto
machine and had also made several varieties
of moving picture projectors, it was not a
hard matter to let it casually be known that the
new apparatus was an attempt to improve either
or both of the old inventions. Thus was gossip
stilled about the big Swift plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, however, did not know what to think
about Greenbaum. The day after the explosion
the man was lamenting loudly that some of
his own experimental apparatus, which he was
working on for the Swift firm, had been destroyed
in the fire and blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” said Tom, telling his father about it,
“since I have promised him a large bonus if he
works out that magnetic gear shift, it doesn’t
seem reasonable that he would set a bomb that
might destroy the results of his own hard
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Tom, it doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet I can’t help suspecting him,” mused
the young inventor. “He is as friendly as ever,
and seems anxious to help me. But there is
something furtive in his manner and in his
looks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Clark find out anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only that Greenbaum went straight to his
boarding place from here and did not go out
again that night. He was at home when the
explosion took place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that clears him, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Dad, it doesn’t. He could easily have
planted a time bomb or rigged one up that was
operated when I opened the door. I shall still
suspect him. But I’ve got something else to
do now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to see how Jackson is coming on with
the new radio tubes he is making for the talking-picture
machine and I’ve got to do something
about Ned. His unexplained absence for so
long a time is getting serious now. It doesn’t
seem possible that he is remaining away voluntarily
without sending some word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Tom, it doesn’t. What do you think?”
and Mr. Swift looked up from his work. He was
making some delicate tests with a galvanometer
in the laboratory, which had been cleaned out
and temporarily fitted up to be used again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m thinking, Dad, that perhaps Ned, in
some way, was concerned with the fire and explosion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom! You don’t mean that Ned——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course I don’t mean that he set it,
Dad!” and Tom laughed at his father’s shocked
face. “I mean that the same rascals who tried
to blow me up kidnapped Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kidnapped a young man like Ned Newton!
A strong, husky chap——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They may have caught him napping,” said
Tom. “Anyhow, I’ve got to do something.
Ned’s folks are much worried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you go to the police?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think a private detective would be better.
Or, best of all, I’ll get Clark and set out on the
trail myself. I’ve got things begun on the rebuilding
of my new machine now, and I’ve really
got to do something about Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you, Tom. I was just wondering——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What he wondered Mr. Swift never stated, as
at that moment a voice was heard out in the corridor,
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my storage battery, you needn’t show
me the way in, Eradicate! I guess I can find
Tom Swift, or what’s left of him! My! My!
It must have been terrible! Bless my stick of
dynamite! So they tried to blow Tom up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Mr. Damon!” said Mr. Swift, smiling at
his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No need for him to send in a card!” chuckled
the young inventor. “His voice and talk give
him away. Come in, Mr. Damon!” he called,
and the door opened to give entrance to the eccentric,
kindly old gentleman who, indirectly,
had been the means of Tom’s starting on his
great inventive career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my handkerchief, Tom!” exclaimed
Mr. Damon, vigorously mopping his face with
the linen article in question, while he held out
one hand to the young inventor. “What’s all
this I hear about you? I just got back from a
Western trip and my wife tells me you were
blown sky high, that your plant was demolished,
and that the whole business is in ruins. Bless
my insurance policies! Whew!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite so bad as that,” Tom answered,
with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But something happened, bless my thermometer
if it didn’t!” declared Mr. Damon,
pointing to a bandage on Tom’s left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there was an accident,” and in a few
words Tom told what had happened, without,
however, making mention of the new machine,
which was too deep a secret as yet for even so
close a friend as the eccentric man to share.
“But it might have been worse,” concluded the
young man. “And, as a matter of fact, that
isn’t the worst that’s happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Tom? What else? Bless my spectacles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned Newton has mysteriously vanished,”
said Tom, with a serious face, and he told as
much as he knew about the strange occurrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s terrible!” declared Mr. Damon. “It’s
the worst outrage I ever heard of! But I came
back just in time, Tom Swift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time for what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To help you hunt for Ned! Now, don’t
stop me! I’m going to do it. I’ll devote all
my time and half my fortune to finding my
young friend and your chum. Tell me more
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve told you all I know, which isn’t much,”
Tom answered. “But suppose we go to the
house. I’m about through here,” and he looked
around the laboratory, asking his father to close
and lock it when he left. “We’ll go over to the
house, Mr. Damon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I want to pay my respects to Mrs. Baggert.
But I can’t get over your accident and
the kidnapping of Ned. Why, bless my——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Damon had no time to complete his
pet phrase, for half way up the path to the
house Tom and his friend saw an old man coming
toward them, ragged and unkempt—a veritable
tramp. He held in his outstretched hand
a dirty piece of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this Mr. Tom Swift?” asked the ragged
man, looking at Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am,” answered the owner of the name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I have a strange message for you,”
went on the tramp in whining tones. “And if
you see fit to reward me for bringing it, I’d be
glad, for I’m a poor old codger and I’m
hungry——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift hastily took the dirty piece of
paper and uttered an exclamation of surprise as
he read what was scrawled on it.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>ON A MYSTERIOUS TRAIL</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“What’s</span> the matter, Tom?” asked Mr. Damon,
for he could not fail to note the agitation
of the young inventor on reading the strange
message brought by so strange a messenger.
“Bless my favorite detective story, but you act
as though you had news!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it proves to be good news and true
news,” said Tom, looking sharply at the whining
old man. “Read that, Mr. Damon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom thrust the dirty piece of paper into the
extended hand of the eccentric man. Slowly,
for the writing was not very clear, Mr. Damon
read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Take this to Tom Swift and receive ten dollars.
Help. Am prisoner at Smith place.
Brick house—flat roof—three cherry trees—old
stone well. Ned Newton.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—why—” faltered Mr. Damon, turning
the paper over, “it’s from—from Ned Newton,
who’s missing. It’s from him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <i>purports</i> to be,” said Tom in a low voice,
looking at the old man who was rubbing with a
lean hand a chin very much in need of the good
offices of a razor. “But it may be a hoax.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it Ned’s writing?” asked Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me look at it again,” suggested the young
inventor. “I was so surprised by the import of
the message that I didn’t pay much attention to
the handwriting.” He scrutinized it closely and
said in a low voice to his odd friend: “It’s
Ned’s scribbling all right. No one else makes
a capital N just like Ned. Where did you get
this?” he asked the old man sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a field, boss. I picked it up and I made
out to read it. I saw your name on it and I
made some inquiries and folks directed me
here. It’s been a long walk, and I’m tired and
hungry and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see that you don’t lose anything by
what you did if this turns out to be no fake,”
said Tom, still a bit sternly. “It will be worth
a good deal more than ten dollars to you if
this leads to the finding of my helper. Now tell
me straight, where did you get this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the field, boss, I told you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What field?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About five miles from here, over Cherry Valley
way. I’m on the tramp—there’s no use lying
to you—I’m a sort of a bum, but it ain’t all
my fault. I work at helping on a farm when
I can, but there’s been so much rain lately I
couldn’t get much to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s right there—it has rained a lot,” said
Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure it has, boss. I’ve been tramping around
and I was cooking a little meal in a field over
Cherry Valley way when I picked up this paper.
I can read—I went to school once,” he said,
with a flash of pride, but it was only a brief flash.
“I read what it said and I asked my way here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did the paper get in the field?” asked
Tom. “Did it blow there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, boss, it come down on a kite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On a <i>kite</i>?” cried Mr. Damon. “Bless my
phonograph, but he’s hoaxing you, Tom! Pay
no attention to him. It’s all a trick to get
money out of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old man did not appear to be one who
would play a joke, and his face was grave as he
made the surprising statement about the kite.
Also there was about him a pathetic, hungry,
hoping look as he glanced at Tom Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say this message came down in a field
on a <i>kite</i>?” asked Tom, and his voice though at
first stern, was now kinder, for he felt sorry for
the old codger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, boss, in a field where I was roasting
some ears of corn a farmer said I could have.
They was almost roasted when down out of the
air swooped this kite. First I thought some
boys must ’a’ been playing around there and it
got away from them. But I didn’t see no boys.
Then I picked up the kite and this message was
on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean this message was tied to the tail
or to the string of the kite itself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it wasn’t tied on. It was part of the
kite—part of the paper the kite was made of.
There wasn’t no string to speak of. Looked
to me like the kite broke away. This message
was writ right on the paper of the kite. It was
partly tore off so I finished ripping it loose, and
put it in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the remainder of the kite?” asked
Tom. He was going to prove this strange tale
to the very bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here ’tis.” The shuffling old tramp drew
from a pocket of his ragged coat a tangled mass
of broken sticks, brown paper and string.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom took the tattered stuff and smoothed it
out. Slowly he assembled it into a small kite
of the kind that needs no tail to be sent up, a
curve of the cross stick and the consequent bellying
of the loose paper serving to hold the wind
against the kite’s surface. From the center of
the kite a piece of the paper had been torn.
This piece was represented by the fragment containing
the message appealing for help. Tom
fitted it in and proved that this part of the old
tramp’s tale was true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks as if there might be something in it,
Tom,” said Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But whether this will help us find Ned
or not is another question. You say this kite
was blown to where you were in the field?” Tom
asked the old fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, boss. It come down right near my
fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From which direction?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tramp considered for a moment and answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right from the south.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom knew that the prevailing winds at this
time of year in the vicinity of Shopton, where
he lived, were from the south. So far the
tramp had not tripped himself up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you make of it, Tom?” asked the
eccentric man as he began an examination of
the remains of the kite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what to think,” was the reply.
“This is most certainly from Ned, and he seems
to be a prisoner on the ‘Smith place,’ wherever
that is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe I can help you out there,” broke in
the tramp. “I asked some questions before I
started off to locate you, and I heard that about
a mile from Cherry Valley is an abandoned
farm known as the Smith place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried Tom. “I’m beginning to believe
you, my man. If this works out it will be
the best day’s work you’ve done for a long
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Tom!” objected Mr. Damon who, in
spite of his eccentricities was hard-headed when
it came to business. “Assuming, Tom, that Ned
is a prisoner on the Smith place, how could he
fly this kite to ask for help? Maybe this man
is just making up that part of the story. He
may be one of those who helped kidnap Ned and
have brought this message from the captors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, boss, honest to goodness I don’t know
nothin’ about no kidnappin’!” cried the tramp,
with vehement earnestness. “It was just as I
told you—I picked that kite up in the field at
Cherry Valley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may have happened as this man says,”
Tom said to Mr. Damon. “If Ned is a prisoner
in some old farmhouse, he may be confined in
an upper room. From there he could loose this
kite and, on a windy day, it might be blown
several miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could he make a kite and fly it
without being seen?” asked Mr. Damon. “And,
when it comes to that, how could he make a
kite, anyhow, if he’s a prisoner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t much of a trick to make this kite,”
replied Tom as he examined the remains of it
again. “It’s made of a section torn from a
paper bag, with sticks whittled off a window
casing, I should say. Ned could do the whittling
with his knife—he always carries one.
Probably they brought him food in a paper
bag, tied with a string. This looks like grocery
store string,” he added, pulling out some strands
from the tangled mess of sticks and paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, having decided to the best of our
knowledge that this message really comes from
Ned and that he is a prisoner at the Smith
place, the next thing to do is to rescue him.
Will you come with us and show us just where
you picked up this message kite?” he asked the
old tramp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I will, boss, but I’m——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know! You’re tired and hungry!” interrupted
the young inventor. “I’ll see that you
get a rest and some food, and you’ll be paid
well. We can’t start at once—a few preparations
are necessary. We’ve got to organize a
searching party and hit the trail after Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m going with you!” cried Mr. Damon.
“No, not a word—don’t forbid me!” he begged
as he saw Tom hesitate. “I’m going!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you think best,” Tom Swift agreed.
“But we’ll have to do considerable before we can
get ready. I think I’ll take Koku along,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good idea!” chuckled Mr. Damon. “He’ll
be a match for any four men that may be holding
Ned a prisoner. But why did they capture
him, Tom? Answer me that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could,” was the musing answer.
“I don’t know what to think. I’m afraid there’s
a deeper plot in all this than I had any idea of
at first. Starting with the attempt to blow
me up, then Ned’s disappearance—I’m afraid
it means that some one objects, very strongly,
to my perfecting—well, what I am perfecting,”
Tom concluded, not wishing to name his latest
invention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let’s get going!” begged Mr. Damon,
with the eagerness and enthusiasm of a boy.
“Now don’t you run away!” he playfully ordered
the old tramp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much chance of that, boss. I’m too
weak hardly to walk, let alone running.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll soon fix you up,” declared Tom, “in
the way of food, anyhow. And you won’t need
to walk. We’ll go in my electric runabout to
the Smith place and get Ned out of the hands
of these scoundrels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of Tom’s haste in making preparations,
it was not until the next morning that he
was able to take the mysterious trail that he
hoped would lead to his kidnapped chum. In
the first place, the old tramp was really so weak
from lack of food and from his long walk that
Dr. Layton said it would not be wise to start
out with him as a guide until he had had a
night’s rest and plenty of nourishing food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a slight accident occurred in one of the
shops and Tom had to straighten that out. It
was not serious, however. So, early the morning
following the receipt of the kite message,
Tom, with Mr. Damon, Koku and Bill Tagg, as
the tramp called himself, started off in the speedy
electric runabout for Cherry Valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as they were about to leave, Jacob
Greenbaum came hurrying out of the private
laboratory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going away, Mr. Swift?” the man
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Tom answered, though he gave no further
particulars. The attempt to rescue Ned
was being kept secret. No information was
given out concerning the identity of the strange
tramp, Bill Tagg, and, aside from a private
message conveyed to Mr. and Mrs. Newton that
Ned had been heard from, nothing was said
about the strange clue. “Yes, Greenbaum, I
am going away for a little trip. Is there anything
you wanted to see me about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Swift, there is. I’ve reached a
critical point in this magnetic gear shift model
and if you could come in my room——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a strange look in the man’s eyes—a
look Tom Swift did not like. The man seemed
unduly eager to get Tom out of the auto and
back into the laboratory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t time, Greenbaum,” the young inventor
said. “I’ll see you when I get back.
That gear shift will keep.” With that Tom
turned on the current and the runabout speeded
down the drive. A look back over his shoulder
showed the man still standing there, with that
same eager, tense look on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Tom to himself, “that my suspicions
of you will soon be justified, Greenbaum.
But just now I’m on the trail of Ned
Newton!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The motors hummed more shrilly as the runabout
gathered speed.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>TOO LATE</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“This</span> is a pretty slick little car, boss,” said
Tagg when they had passed the confines of
Shopton and were heading out into the country.
“She sure can go! Beats old Shanks’ mare,”
and he looked down at his legs which had carried
him to Tom’s home with the mysterious
message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tramp had been provided with some decent
clothes, he had taken a bath and shaved,
and was quite a different looking man from the
one who first encountered Mr. Damon and Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” admitted the young inventor as he
listened to the hum of the small but powerful
motors as they received their impulses from the
storage battery Tom had evolved. “At one
time this was the speediest car on the road, but
I have some now that can beat this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they aren’t in it with some of the airships
Mr. Swift has,” remarked Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I want to do before I die, boss,”
murmured the tramp. “I want to ride in an airship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if we rescue my friend through your
help, I’ll see that you have your wish,” promised
the head of the Swift plant. “It’s easily
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gee, boss, but I sure would love that!” murmured
Bill Tagg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Airship—him lots good!” grunted Koku,
who sat stolidly on the rear seat with the tramp,
listening to the talk. Koku was not much given
to conversation, but when it came to fighting
he was as wide awake and as lively as heart
could wish. Tom had brought the giant along
in case there should be a fight, which seemed
likely. Men who go to the length of kidnapping
seldom stop there in their desperate ventures.
“Lots good—airships!” rumbled Koku in his
deep voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to know. You came from your
country of giants in one,” chuckled Mr. Damon,
for he well remembered that exciting trip, the
details of which will be found set down in another
volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom knew the road to Cherry Valley, and it
did not take long, in his speedy car, to arrive in
the vicinity. The entrance to the valley led up
a long hill, and the car was half way over this
rather stiff climb when there was a sudden
grinding noise from the machinery and the runabout
stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something wrong!” cried Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds that way,” admitted Tom as he made
a quick turn and let the car back slowly down
against a tree at the side of the road where it
was held safely from rolling farther in case the
brakes did not hold. In an instant the young
inventor was out and peering into the interior
of his runabout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dirty work here!” he exclaimed as he pulled
out a twisted piece of metal. “See what was in
the gears!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” asked Mr. Damon, who did not
know much about machinery, as you can guess
when you read how he managed the first motorcycle
he bought. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A screw driver!” exclaimed Tom. “It was
put in here, suspended on a piece of rope in
such a manner that the rope would gradually
wear through, letting the screw driver drop into
the gears. And that’s just what happened!
One set of gears is chewed to nothing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s bad!” said Mr. Damon. His scant
knowledge of machinery was sufficient for him
to understand that something vitally wrong had
happened to the car, even if the serious look on
Tom’s face had not informed him of the same
fact. “How did it happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It didn’t happen—it was caused!” was the
answer. “Some one, just before we started out,
suspended this screw driver in the gear box
knowing that after we had run a few miles the
rope would wear through and the thing would
drop. Dirty work!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to be getting a lot of bad breaks
lately, Tom,” said the odd man. “Who do you
suppose did this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s the same man I suspect of other
things,” was the reply. “I’m going to find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we stuck, Tom? Can’t we go on and
rescue Ned?” Mr. Damon inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, we can go on, but we can’t make
much speed. I’ll have to run in third. Fourth
and fifth gears are all chewed up.” It was because
of its five selective speeds that the electric
runabout was such a wonderful machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoever did this made a little mistake,”
chuckled Tom, for he had a saving sense of
humor. “If they’d fixed it so the screw driver
dropped into the lower gears we never could have
started again once we stopped. As it is, we can
go on, but we can’t make speed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not take him long to cut out the two
higher gearing mechanism attachments, and then
the runabout proceeded again. Even at the
lowered rate its speed was better than that of
many gasoline automobiles. And in due time
the head of the slope was reached. Before the
searchers lay Cherry Valley which, they hoped,
contained the Smith place and the captive Ned
Newton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Tagg, show us the field where you saw
the kite come down,” requested Tom when they
were driving along a level road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about a mile farther on,” the tramp said,
looking about for landmarks. “Yes, just about
a mile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This distance was soon covered, and when the
car was stopped Tagg led the way into the field
and showed where he had built a fire to roast
ears of corn. The blackened ashes and the remains
of his feast proved that, so far, he had
spoken the truth. Then he showed just where
he had picked up the broken kite, and some
fragments of the brown-bag paper which bore
Ned’s message were found among the hills of
corn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks as if we were on the right track,”
said Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” murmured Tom. “Now to locate
the Smith place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s south of here, about a mile and a half,”
said the tramp. “ ’Tisn’t a very good road,
though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That won’t keep us back,” declared Tom, and
once more they were on the way. The runabout
was doing fairly well in spite of the handicap
of two stripped gears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cherry Valley was rather a sparsely settled
part of the country and as Tom and his friends
advanced they noticed that it grew more and
more deserted. They passed one ramshackle
farmhouse and learned, on inquiry, that they
were headed right for the old Smith homestead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they don’t nobody live there now, mister,”
said a slattern of a woman who shuffled to
the door in response to Tom’s knock. “They
ain’t been nobody livin’ in the Smith place nigh
onto four years now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right—we’ll find it I guess,” responded
the young inventor, and once more he
drove his electric car onward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the end of the valley and adjoining a
patch of dense woods, they came upon the Smith
house. It had once been the home of a prosperous
farmer, but he had fallen upon evil days
and the place had long been deserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it!” cried Mr. Damon, catching sight
of the old brick house. “There it is, three
cherry trees, old stone well, and everything just
as Ned described it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, please! Not so loud!” begged Tom,
slowing up his car and guiding it behind a clump
of trees not far from the house. “If we’re going
to make a rescue it might be well to take
these kidnappers by surprise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my ear trumpet, I never thought of
that!” whispered the odd man. “Of course!
Certainly! Yes! Quiet does it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you use a gun?” asked Tom curtly of
the tramp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, boss, I’m not a very good shot,
but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe there’ll be any need of shooting,”
interrupted Tom, “but there’s no use taking
any chances. Here,” and he handed the
tramp an automatic pistol, reserving one for himself
and giving Mr. Damon another. “We may
have an easy time and we may have a hard one,”
said Tom. “But, whatever it is, I’m going to
rescue Ned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t Koku want a gun?” asked the tramp,
noting that the giant carried no weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me no shoot. Me scrunch um in my hands
me catch!” muttered the giant, opening and
closing his immense fists. It was answer
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll approach from four sides at once,” decided
Tom as they began to creep cautiously
toward the old farmhouse. “Separate now.
You to the east, Mr. Damon; you west, Tagg;
you south, Koku; and I’ll take the north side.
When I whistle we’ll rush the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Correct!” said Mr. Damon in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waiting until he was sure they were in their
places, Tom looked toward the old house. It
seemed deserted, quiet and lonely. But from
behind the sagging shutters of the grimy and
broken windows evil eyes might be peering out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom gave a low whistle. On his left he could
hear Mr. Damon beginning to run forward and
on his right he caught the sound of the advance
of Tagg. Then Tom began to run, and
beyond the house he caught a glimpse of the
giant lurching forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together the four searchers reached the four
sides of the old house, but still there was no sign
of life. The front door was on Tom’s side and,
his weapon ready, he ran up the steps. He
tried the door. To his surprise, it gave and he
pushed it open. At the same time he heard
Koku crash through the open door on the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way!” cried Tom to Mr. Damon and
the tramp. “Rush ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An instant later they were in the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surrender!” yelled Tom, though he saw no
one. “You’re surrounded! Surrender!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hurried search of the first floor revealed no
one. A look through the second floor was likewise
unsuccessful. The attic revealed not a
soul and the cellar was tenantless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re too late!” exclaimed Tom Swift.
“They’ve gone! But they have been here!” he
declared, pointing into a room with iron bars
over the only window. “They’ve been here and
I believe Ned was a prisoner here. Yes, he
was!” he cried, picking something up in a corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know Ned was here?” asked
Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is his stickpin,” Tom replied, showing
a scarf ornament of silver and jade. “Ned’s
been here all right. But they have taken him
away. We’re too late!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s to be done now?” asked Tagg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow them!” cried Tom. “We’ve got to
get Ned back. Let’s have another look around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked, but found little to aid them in
their search.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They haven’t been gone long!” cried Tom,
as they came out of the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?” asked Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stove is still warm,” was the answer.
“Come on! We’ve got to trail them and get
Ned!”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A WILD CHASE</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span> was the first of the four searchers
to rush out of the old brick farmhouse, ready
to take up the trail once more in the search.
Mr. Damon followed, then came Bill Tagg, and
lastly the big, lumbering Koku.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me find nobody can smash,” the giant complained
as he clenched his immense fists. “Master
say maybe I fight. No fight?” and he looked
at Tom questioningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be a fight yet, if we can catch
them,” said the young inventor, pausing a moment
in the front to look back at the house.
“They’ve given us the slip. If it hadn’t been
for the accident to my electric runabout we’d
have been here sooner and we’d have caught
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Damon. “It looks, Tom,
as if the somebody who tried to wreck your machine
had an interest in preventing your getting
here sooner. They, whoever it was, wanted
to delay you so word could be sent here to get
Ned out of the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very probable,” admitted the young
inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he looked up at the window of what had
been his chum’s prison room, and Tom tried to
picture how Ned, in his desperation, had secretly
constructed the kite of wrapping paper,
whittled sticks and string. Then the young
manager had waited until a stiff wind was blowing
and had loosed the silent messenger into the
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The electric runabout was in the road a short
distance away from the deserted farmhouse.
Tom wished he had time to repair it so the machine
would show some of the former speed, but
this was out of the question. They would have
to go along as best they could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vicinity of the farmhouse was lonesome
and no other building was in view save a tumbledown
barn. Tom, therefore, and his companions
were rather surprised when, on coming out
of the yard, they saw a ragged boy in the road
walking around the runabout and admiring it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” called Tom genially. “Do you live
near here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just down the road a piece.” The boy dug
his dirty, bare toes into the soft dust of the
road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know anybody who lives in here?” went
on the young inventor, seeing a possible chance
to get some information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t nobody live here,” the boy replied.
“But there’s been some men in here the last few
days, only they’re gone now. They went away
a little while ago in an auto, but it was bigger’n
what yours is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so some men went away from here a little
while ago in a big auto, did they?” asked Tom.
“We’re on the track!” he whispered to Mr. Damon.
Then to the boy again: “What kind of
men were they and how many of them were
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They was just men,” the boy replied. “Men
like you,” and he comprised the four in a roving
glance. “But they wasn’t dressed so good as
what you are—you three I mean,” and he indicated
Tom, Mr. Damon and Koku. He seemed
to omit Tagg, and a moment later the reason
was obvious. For the boy added: “They was
dressed more like what he is,” and he pointed directly
at the tramp. In spite of the fact that
Bill Tagg had been freshened up considerably
since he shuffled to Tom with Ned’s message,
there was still an air of vagrancy about the
wanderer. It stuck out all over him. He did
not seem to mind being made use of for this not
very flattering comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many men were there?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three well ones and a sick one,” the boy answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sick man!” exclaimed Mr. Damon.
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, his head was tied up in rags and the
other men carried him out on a cot. He didn’t
say nothin’, the sick man didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was Ned!” murmured Mr. Damon.
“Bless my doctor’s bill, Tom, but do you think
they’ve done for poor Ned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t think so,” was the reply. “I
think they gagged Ned so he couldn’t call for
help, and they probably bound him with rope.
Naturally he couldn’t walk, and they had to
carry him out. So he would appear to be a sick
person. Well, we know how many we have to
fight—three men,” he concluded. “Can you tell
me anything more about the men who were here,
son?” asked Tom, tossing the boy a quarter
which the lad picked up in his toes after it had
fallen in the dust near him. “Did you see them
often?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sneaked down here pretty near every day
after they come to this old house,” the boy answered.
“They didn’t see me, ’cause I hid in
the bushes. But they was funny men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean—funny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They used to fly kites out of the window—anyhow,
one of ’em did. But I couldn’t see him
plain, ’cause there’s iron bars over that window—up
there,” and he pointed to the casement of
the room where Tom had found Ned’s stick pin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So one of the men flew kites out of that window,
did he?” encouraged Tom. “What happened
to them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most of ’em fell in the weeds,” the boy
said. “They wasn’t very good kites—just made
of old, brown-bag paper. I can make better
kites ’n them. They was made of old sticks. I
picked some of ’em up, but they wasn’t any
good. One flew a long way off, though. I
couldn’t find that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see just what happened,” Tom spoke
in a low voice to Mr. Damon. “Poor Ned tried
two or three kite messengers before he finally
got one into a stiff breeze that carried it to
Cherry Valley. But we are losing valuable
time. Which way did the three well men take
the sick man in their big auto?” Tom asked
the barefooted lad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down there,” and he pointed to the western
road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where does that lead to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lake Carlopa, ’bout ten miles farther on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lake Carlopa!” cried Tom. “That’s where
they’re heading for. Come on! We may catch
them yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tossing the lad another quarter, Tom led his
friends toward his car and they were soon off
again on the wild chase. They had a definite
object now, for the lad had given them such a
description of the other auto as to make it easy
for them to inquire about it along the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their inquiries were fruitful to the extent that
at several garages and hot-dog stands along the
highway the pursuers learned that the machine
in question, containing three men and one who
appeared to be ill or injured had passed not long
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re catching up to them!” Tom exulted,
when they had covered half the distance to Lake
Carlopa. This was evident by the information
given at different garages. Whereas at first the
fleeing car had been half an hour ahead, it was
now but ten minutes. “We’ll get them!” cried
the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Tom got every inch of speed possible
out of his crippled runabout, when Lake Carlopa
was reached they found the kidnappers’
car abandoned on the shore of the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just too late again!” sighed Mr. Damon.
“We’ll never get Ned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We may!” shouted Tom. “Look!” He
pointed across the lake, and about half a mile
out was discerned a motorboat containing three
men. “There they are—I’m sure of it!” cried
Tom. “Now if we only had another boat to
chase them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a feller a little farther on who rents
motorboats,” volunteered Bill Tagg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried Tom. “We’ll chase them in
their own way. Where’s that motorboat chap?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tramp pointed out the dock, and in a short
time, leaving his runabout in charge of the boat
proprietor, Tom and his friends were in a sturdy
gasoline craft giving chase to the other, which
was now but a speck amid the blue waters of
Lake Carlopa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think they have Ned with them?”
asked Mr. Damon while Tom hastily adjusted
the motor so as to get the maximum speed from
the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” was the reply. “We’ll soon find
out, if this old tub can stand the pace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have we a chance?” asked Bill, who was taking
quite an interest in this pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom looked at the fleeing boat. Then he calculated
the speed of the craft he had hired. A
few minutes of observation caused him to make
this remark:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re gaining on them—slowly. Whether
we catch up to them before they get to the other
side is a question. We’ll do our best to catch
’em, however.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a slight adjustment in the carburetor
to get a few more revolutions per minute
from the flywheel and then the four settled back
for the chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom’s statement about their speed proved
true. In a short time it was discerned that his
craft was overhauling the other. The three men
could be plainly seen now, and a muffled object
could be made out in the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my cranberry sauce, there’s Ned!”
cried Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” murmured Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chase was now becoming exciting. Every
moment they were drawing nearer the fleeing
boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on there, you fellows!” shouted Tom.
“We want to speak to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t got time!” sneered one of the three
rascals. “See you later!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the boat in front swerved off to one
side. But Tom was ready for this and shifted
his own wheel to intercept the other craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out! Rocks!” suddenly cried Mr. Damon.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>TWO CAPTIVES</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“What’s</span> that? What’s the matter?” cried
Tom Swift, hearing Mr. Damon’s shout. “Are
they going to ram us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had been bending over the gasoline throttle
in an endeavor to coax a little more speed
out of their craft. Now he looked up to see
that they were very near the fleeing boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I said rocks ahead! Look! Bless my
life preserver, we’re going to hit them!” yelled
the eccentric man. “Look out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, but too late, Tom saw and realized why
the other boat had swerved so suddenly. It was
to avoid the rocks. And now the <i>Gull</i>, which
was the name of the boat Tom had hired, was
headed directly for the black, sharp rocks that
reared their ugly heads out of the blue water of
Lake Carlopa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hand me that boat hook and maybe I can
fend us off,” called out the tramp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, however, was sure this would be of no
service, so he did not obey the request. He was
trying with all his might to pull the wheel around
far enough to steer the <i>Gull</i> away from the rocks.
But the craft was a heavy one, rather clumsy,
and did not respond readily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See if she’ll reverse, Mr. Damon!” panted
Tom, who had to use both hands on the wheel.
“Throw that lever back!” and he pointed to
one with his foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know how!” Mr. Damon replied. He
grasped the gear lever and began straining on
it. Suddenly there was a sharp report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did it break?” cried Tom, looking at the
rocks on to which they seemed about to crash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. They’re shooting at us!” yelled Bill
Tagg. “There they go again!” he added, ducking
down into the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and Mr. Damon were both occupied
with trying to save the <i>Gull</i> from going on the
rocks and they could not draw their weapons.
The tramp, however, aimed his automatic and
sent a couple of answering shots toward the boat
containing Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out you don’t hit our friend,” warned
Tom, who felt the rudder gradually coming
around, so that he had hopes of saving the <i>Gull</i>
from a direct crash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fired over their heads,” explained Bill Tagg.
“They’re doing the same, I guess—trying to
bluff us!” He fired again, high enough to clear
those in the fleeing craft, and again came a response.
This time the bullet was lower and
Tom instinctively ducked, though he knew the
missile must have passed him before his ear
caught the vicious whine of its passage through
the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, so suddenly that no warning was given,
the <i>Gull</i> struck on a rock just beneath the surface.
It was a glancing blow, and the rock,
luckily, was smooth, or the craft might have
been shattered. As it was, the <i>Gull</i> careened to
one side, and so sharply that Tom Swift was
thrown overboard, landing in the lake with a
great splash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instinctively, he took a long breath and held
it, closing his mouth that had been opened preparatory
to shouting further directions to Mr.
Damon about reversing the craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down into the depths sank Tom, while the
<i>Gull</i>, whose speed was not slackened, slued
around from her impact on the rock and shot off
on a tangent in a direction directly opposite
from that taken by the <i>Turtle</i>, the boat containing
the three roughly attired men and that silent,
wrapped figure in the bottom—a figure that
was supposed to be Ned Newton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my steamship ticket!” yelled Mr. Damon,
“where’s Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Overboard!” yelled the tramp. “And I can’t
swim!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me get him!” shouted Koku, peeling off his
coat preparatory to a dive over the side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay where you are!” came the stern command
from the other boat which had circled
around and was now headed for the place where
Tom Swift’s head appeared in the watery circles
caused by his plunge. “We’ll drill the first man
that goes overboard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of the rascals stood in the bow with
leveled weapons, while the third was steering
the boat straight toward Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re going to ram him!” gasped the
tramp. He did not seem capable of doing anything
to help, and Koku, being now without a
weapon, was of no service. Mr. Damon had laid
aside his pistol to work the reverse lever and,
even if he could have recovered it, there was a
question as to his ability to use it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus fate favored the rascals, and Mr. Damon
and his two companions were forced to see themselves
being carried farther and farther away
from the <i>Turtle</i> as the <i>Gull</i>, whose engine was
still running, headed away from the rocks. Apparently
little damage had been done by striking
the obstruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a distance Mr. Damon, the tramp, and
the giant watched to see what would happen to
Tom Swift. At first it seemed as though he
was going to be run down by the unprincipled
men in the <i>Turtle</i>. But they had other plans in
mind and, reaching the swimming inventor, the
two men in the bow reached over, grasped him,
and pulled him in. He could not fight back,
and, indeed, having gone overboard with all his
clothes on, was having a hard struggle to keep
afloat. Rescue, even at the hands of the enemy,
was welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got him!” gasped Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We go take him away!” growled Koku.
“Make boat go odder way, Mr. Damon—we get
Master Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I’m afraid I don’t know how to operate
this craft,” confessed the eccentric man. “I
might run it back on the rocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once Tom was hauled, dripping wet, aboard
the <i>Turtle</i>, the boat was put about and went
speeding off and away from the <i>Gull</i> which, to
tell the truth, was headed back toward her own
dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, as he was pulled over the side, had a
glimpse of the <i>Gull</i> going back where she came
from. He remembered that neither Mr. Damon
nor Koku could operate the craft without some
one along to advise them, and the young inventor
had doubts about the tramp’s navigating
ability in the emergency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyhow, she’ll get to shore and they’ll
be all right,” reasoned Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he gave thought to his own situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ve sure got him now!” chuckled one
of the three men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it!” echoed another. “We didn’t
make no mistake this time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom almost fell on the gagged and bound
body of another young man, and it needed but
a glance to show him that here was Ned Newton,
a prisoner like himself. Ned could not
speak and could hardly move, but his eyes
flashed a greeting to Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got us both!” said Tom in a low
voice to his chum, as he crawled alongside of
Ned. “But they won’t keep us long. Are you
hurt, Ned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shake of the head in negation was the only
way Ned could reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then further talk on Tom’s part was stopped,
for one of the men, standing over the two captives
with an automatic in one hand, growled:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up down there!”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>ON THE ISLAND</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Not</span> one to submit tamely to indignities, Tom
Swift, instead of complying with the command,
struggled to his feet and advanced toward the
two rough men standing in the bow of the boat.
The third member was at the wheel and, Tom
noticed, was heading the boat out toward the
wider part of the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” said Tom boldly, for his nerve,
somewhat shaken by his sudden plunge into the
water, was coming back to him. “What’s your
game, anyhow? What do you mean by keeping
Mr. Newton and me on this boat? I demand
that you set us ashore at once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you do, eh?” chuckled one of the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do! And if you do it within a reasonable
time I may overlook what you’ve done.
But if you don’t at once release us I’ll cause your
arrest, and it will go hard with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to him!” sneered one of the scoundrels.
“You’d think he was chief of police or something
like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Ha!” chuckled another. “We’ve got
Tom Swift right where we want him this time.
No mistake now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was beginning to understand some things
in connection with the kidnapping—things hitherto
a mystery to him. He looked at the men.
They were burly, brutal fellows and Tom knew
that even if Ned were free to help him, they
would not be able to fight these fellows. Perhaps
subterfuge and craft were better than a
show of force. Tom decided on other tactics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” he said again. “I don’t know
what your game is, but you’re bound to lose out
in the end. My friends will soon rescue us and
you’ll be jailed for this. Kidnapping is a serious
offense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We took one chance and we got the wrong
man,” said one of the fellows, thus confirming
Tom’s new suspicions. “Now we have the right
one—that’s you—and we’re going to hold on to
you. We don’t worry none about getting
jailed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve rich friends that’ll soon get us out,”
said the man at the wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up, Torpy!” commanded one of the two
in the bow. “Close your trap! You talk too
much!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, you make me tired!” complained the
one addressed as Torpy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t bluff us, Tom Swift!” went on the
largest of the three scoundrels. “We got you
dead to rights now and you’ll tell us what we
want to know before we let you go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so you’re after information, are you?”
asked Tom, hoping to draw the men out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind?” Tom inquired, trying to wring
some of the water out of his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find out soon enough when we get to
the island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What island?” the young inventor wanted
to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ask too many questions. You’re as bad
as Torpy—you talk too much!” complained one
of the two in the bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom glanced down at Ned and, guessing how
his friend must be suffering, bound and gagged
as he was, decided on a new plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he seemed to agree, “I’ll stop asking
questions. But as long as you’ve got me
safe, as you seem to have, there’s no object in
keeping my chum trussed up as he is. Why
don’t you loosen him and take that rag out of
his mouth? Be decent, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might as well let up on him a bit,” said
the big man. “As he says, we got him now and
the other can’t do any harm if he does yell.
We’re out of the way now—soon be at the
island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” assented his companion, and they at
once loosened Ned’s ropes and removed the gag,
for which relief he was very grateful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened, old man?” asked Tom in a
low voice, as he sat down on the bottom of the
boat beside his now unbound chum. “We’ve
been all upset over you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been a bit upset myself,” admitted Ned,
whose tongue was thick from the effects of the
gag. “But, in brief, I was set upon that night
after I left your laboratory, a cloth was thrown
over my head at a dark corner, not far from your
place, and, before I knew what was happening, I
was gagged, bound, and bundled into an auto.
I was taken some distance and brought to that
old farmhouse. The men hustled me out of
there a little while ago, and after a wild ride put
me in this boat. You know the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been kept in the old Smith place
ever since you were kidnapped up until a little
while ago?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they held me a prisoner there. But it
didn’t take them long to find out I was the
wrong man. They mistook me for you, and
thought they were kidnapping the great inventor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had begun to suspect that,” said Tom.
“Well, what happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they were pretty much upset when they
learned who I was,” chuckled Ned. “They
asked me a lot of questions about your inventions,
and wanted to know how the new talking-picture
projector worked. But of course I was
as mum as an oyster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did they ask specifically about my new patent?”
asked Tom, somewhat excited by this
news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what they did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did they know about it? I supposed
that was a dead secret from all but you, dad and
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So did I,” responded Ned. “But there must
be a leak somewhere around your shop. Perhaps
a spy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe there is!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried to escape, but I couldn’t,” said Ned.
“Even though they found out I was the wrong
man, they still held me. I was kept in an upper
room with barred windows. Then, when
they brought me food in paper bags, I thought
of the kite idea. I sent out half a dozen, but
I guess they didn’t blow far. I wrote messages
to you, hoping some one would pick them up
and take them to you. But I began to think
nothing would come of it until one day a kite
that I’d made went high up in the air and I
knew it would travel a long way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It did,” said Tom. “All the way to Cherry
Valley where a tramp picked it up and brought
it to me. That was yesterday, and I came as
soon as I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you would,” Ned responded.
“But when, a little while ago, they bundled me
up again and took me away, I thought it was
all up with me. They must have had some
warning you were on their trail, they got off in
such a hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think the same man who tried to blow me
up gave the warning,” stated Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tried to blow you up!” gasped Ned. “What
do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom told of the explosion and fire, relating
the sad tale of the wrecking of the talking-picture
machine, but in words that would mean
nothing to the three men even if they should
hear. But they did not appear to be listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” exclaimed Ned. “You were as
badly off as I was!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty near,” agreed Tom. “We couldn’t
imagine what had become of you. Your folks
were worried, but I sent word to them about your
kite message and that relieved their minds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you start to swim after me?” asked Ned,
with a smile, noting Tom’s wet clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swim? No. Oh, I see what you mean!
You couldn’t see what happened because you
were down on the bottom here. Well, I was
chasing these fellows in a motorboat I’d hired,
with Mr. Damon, Koku and the tramp that
picked up your kite. We hit a rock and I went
overboard. Then they hauled me in, for my
boat slued off and I guess headed back for her
own dock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tough luck!” murmured Ned. “Well, what’s
the next item on the bill, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were not left long in doubt. A few minutes
later the speed of the boat began to slacken
and, looking ahead, Tom and Ned saw that the
craft was approaching a large island. It was
known to the young men as a rendezvous for
criminals and other unsavory characters. Tom
had not visited Rattlesnake Island, as it was
called, for a number of years, nor had his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to land us there?” Tom demanded,
as he saw that the boat was heading for
a dilapidated dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it!” chuckled one of the men who,
Ned said, was named Snogg. The other, and
larger, was addressed as Janner. Those two,
with Torpy, comprised the kidnapping gang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you leave us here, will you be decent
enough to send some one to take us off after you
get away?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry—we’re not going away!” sneered
Janner. “We’ll be right with you all the while,
boys!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was plain, then, that Tom and Ned were to
be held captive on the island with the three unscrupulous
men as guards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you can walk along quiet if you choose,
or, if you want to kick up a fuss, we’ll bind, gag
and carry you,” said Snogg, when the boat was
made fast to the dock. “Which’ll it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since we can’t help ourselves,” replied Tom
bitterly, “we’ll go quietly. But we won’t submit
to any indignities!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t be any worse treated than you
have been,” said Janner. “And if you come
across and answer my questions you’ll get home
all the sooner. It’s up to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this Tom Swift made no answer and a little
later he and Ned were led toward a rough,
two-story house, situated near the middle of
Rattlesnake Island, and left to themselves,
locked in a room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this is that!” said Ned as he sank
down on a chair near the bed, for there was
some furniture in the room. “What do you
think they’ll do to us, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard to say. I don’t quite fathom their
game, unless it’s to make me give up the secret
of——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not finish, but Ned knew what was
meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope they feed us, anyhow,” sighed Tom’s
manager. “They gave me pretty decent food
back in the farmhouse, but I haven’t had any
breakfast, and I need it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this there was silence. A few minutes
later the door was unlocked and Torpy came in
with two trays of fairly good food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boss says you’re to eat and then he’ll
be up and question you,” the man reported.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t get much out of me,” snapped
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor me!” added Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better not r’ile the boss,” was Torpy’s
advice as he put the trays down on a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned was very hungry, and Tom Swift, in spite
of his rage, anxiety, and his recent ducking, was
also beginning to feel an appetite. So the young
men ate and then, casually, Tom began strolling
around the room seeking a possible chance to
escape. To his disappointment the apartment
was more solid than it looked. The door was
heavy and securely locked and the window covered
with a heavy wire screen and iron bars.
Evidently the room had been used before as a
prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom Swift did not give up very easily,
and now he had still several cards to play in the
desperate game with the three men. When the
food had been satisfactorily disposed of, the
door opened again and big Janner came swaggering
in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I see you had your appetites with you,
boys,” he remarked. “And now we’ll get down
to business. It’s you I want to talk with, Tom
Swift, and not your manager that we took away
in a hurry by mistake for you. He don’t know
the answers to some of the questions I’m going
to ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe I don’t, either,” observed Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes you do!” was the quick retort.
“And you’ll tell me, too, or I’ll find a way to
make you!” The man’s voice was an ugly snarl
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see,” was all Tom said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then began a rapid series of questions concerning
some of Tom’s recent inventions, including
his <i>Air Monarch</i> in which he had circled the
globe. As this machine had lately been turned
over to the Government for use in the Air Service,
there was no secret about it, and Tom had
no hesitation in telling things concerning it. He
thought it might put Janner in a better humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the <i>Air Monarch</i>, the man switched to
other machines about which greater secrecy was
desirable, and Tom refused to answer inquiries,
though his refusals did not appear to anger Janner
much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s your photo telephone doing these
days?” the man suddenly inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That? Why, most people know all there’s
to be known about that. It’s an old invention
of mine,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it? But I understand you’re using something
like it now to make pictures appear inside
a radio machine!” Janner suddenly shot at
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once the young inventor saw the drift of
the inquiries. There had been some leak in connection
with his recent work on the talking-picture
machine, and these men, or this man,
knew about it. Tom did some quick thinking
just then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t any machine that will make pictures
appear in a radio receiver,” Tom said
calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was true enough. The fire and blast
had destroyed the best part of the new invention,
though Tom had plans for rebuilding and
perfecting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you haven’t got such a machine, eh?”
sneered Janner. “Well, I know you have.
We’re not going to let you spoil our business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What business is that?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind. We’re not going to let you
make a machine that will permit folks to sit at
home and see and hear a show without paying
the admission price. Not in a thousand years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a flash Tom knew now who were at the bottom
of the plot against him. Powerful moving
picture and theater interests would not want to
see such an invention as Tom Swift planned
put on the market. It would bring ruin to
many of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got such a machine, or you’ll soon
have one, and I know it!” stormed Janner.
Tom knew, then, that he had been spied upon.
“And I’m going to make you tell all about it
and promise to drop it!” fairly shouted Janner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got a big contract on your hands,”
stated Tom calmly. “I’ll tell you nothing and
there isn’t a man or a company living that can
make me drop anything I undertake until I’m
ready to let go of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is that so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess we can find ways and means to
make you!” said Janner in a snarling voice as
he advanced toward Tom Swift.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE ESCAPE</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Instinctively</span> Ned Newton, who had pretty
well recovered from the harsh treatment accorded
him while bound and gagged, started to
Tom’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young inventor, seeing that a fight was
imminent, also prepared for it. Though he still
felt the effects of the shock and injuries attendant
upon the attempt to blow him up, he was in
a fighting mood and did not shrink from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll make you tell what I want to know!”
snarled Janner. “You haven’t anybody here
to help you now, Tom Swift. You’ll either give
up that secret and give the plans to me or you’ll
wish you’d never fallen into my hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish that now,” replied Tom coolly. “Not
that I’m afraid of your hands,” he added, bracing
himself for the struggle he felt sure was coming,
“but I don’t like your company nor that
of your gang. So you have my regrets already,
though as for any secrets I may have, or any
new inventions, they remain my exclusive property!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they do, do they?” sneered the man.
“Well, we’ll see——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about to rush upon Tom and Ned,
who stood side by side ready to ward off the assault,
when there came a call from the hall outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Janner! Hop to it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked the big ruffian.
“Don’t bother me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Chief is on the wire!” came the answer,
and Tom and Ned recognized Snogg’s voice.
“He wants to talk to you. Step on it—the
Chief’s in a hurry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case your affair can wait,” said the
big fellow, with a threatening gesture toward
the two young men. “Don’t think you’re going
to get away,” he added. “I’ll be back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked to the door, still facing the two,
tapped on it without turning about and, when it
was opened from the hall, evidently by Snogg,
the big plotter stepped outside and quickly
locked the door again before Tom and Ned had
a chance to rush him, which Janner evidently
expected would happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a chance we missed!” exclaimed
Ned, when he heard the lock click. “We might
have bowled them over, Tom, and gotten away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that idea occurred to me. But it was
too risky. These fellows may not intend to kill
us, but even if they only shot at us to cripple
us something might go wrong and we’d get a
bullet where it would do a lot of damage. I
think we can get the best of them in another
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have a look around this place and see
if we can’t escape—perhaps not now, but after
dark. It will soon be night. This room looks
strong, but from the outside the house didn’t
look either strongly built or in good repair.
We’ll have a go at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m with you, Tom. But what do you
think’s going on now? What was that talk
about the Chief being on the wire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It bears out what I have been thinking for
some time,” replied the young inventor. “These
fellows who have kidnapped us are not the principals
in this matter. They are an organized
gang, but they are working at the behest of
others. I could tell, from the way Janner asked
questions about my inventions, that he had no
real, scientific knowledge. He had been told to
ask those questions by some one who did know,
however. He made several breaks that I passed
over. I wanted to see how far he would go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the game, Tom? They went to a
good deal of preliminary trouble—I mean kidnapping
me for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Admittedly on their part, that was a mistake,”
said Tom. “It was me they were after
all the time, only you happened to leave the laboratory
first and they pounced on you. Then
came the explosion. Whether that was set to go
off and destroy my laboratory after I was supposed
to be out of it or whether they really
wanted to do me up, I don’t know. But they’ve
got both of us now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any idea who they may be, Tom—I mean
these men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They might be the Hussy and Kilborn
crowd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that bunch of the <i>Red Arrow</i> who
tried to stop us from circling the globe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s who I mean. However, it’s only a
guess. It may turn out to be an entirely different
gang. But now that we have a little time
to ourselves, let’s look around and see what the
chances are for getting away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dusk, but by the last rays of the setting
sun which shone through the window, the young
men began a tour of the apartment, seeking any
possible means of exit. Naturally, they first
gave their attention to the window and door.
As stated before, the former was screened not
only with a wire mesh, but also with strong iron
bars. A search through the pockets of Tom
and Ned revealed, in the way of tools, only two
knives. Tom’s knife contained a small screw
driver, and at first he thought he might be able
to loosen the fastenings of the screen and window
bars. But it did not take long to demonstrate
that a much more powerful instrument
would be needed for this work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow, if we did get the bars off we’d have
a big drop to the ground,” said Ned. “We’re
higher up than I thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could improvise a rope from the
bed-clothes,” suggested Tom, indicating them.
“That would be the easiest part of it. But those
bars were put there to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe we can whittle away the wood enough
to loosen the screws,” suggested Ned. They
tried this, but the space to work in was cramped,
the wood was tough, and when Ned broke the
largest blade of his knife and cut his hand rather
severely in so doing, Tom insisted that they
give up this attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s try the door,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now dark in the room, but both young
men had matches, Tom’s being in a waterproof
case which had kept dry during his sudden bath,
and with these they made as good an examination
of the door and its frame as was possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lock defied picking with the poor tools at
their disposal, and when this had been proved
Tom said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can cut a hole through the door near the
lock, big enough for a hand to get through, and
maybe we can turn the lock that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s worth trying,” Ned declared. “We’ll
work at it in shifts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their captors seemed to have made up their
minds to leave the prisoners alone, though
voices and movements in the rooms below indicated
that the three men were still on guard.
Perhaps orders had come from the mysterious
“Chief” not to attempt violence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was more than enough food in the supply
which had been brought to provide a late
supper and even breakfast for the captives, and
there was a large jug of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the hours of the night, Tom Swift
and Ned Newton toiled desperately to cut a hole
through the door. With only pocket knives to
work with, it was tremendously difficult labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was long past midnight when Tom, whose
turn it was at the task, uttered an exclamation
of dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned, who had
thrown himself on the bed to rest. “Break your
knife or cut yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither,” Tom replied. “But we’ll have to
give this up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s an iron plate outside this door. I’ve
cut through the wood and come to the iron. It’s
all off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a bitter disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll try something else in the morning,”
decided Tom after a moment, closing his knife
with a snap. “Meanwhile, I’m going to get
some rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we both need it,” admitted Ned, with a
weary sigh. “But when they come in here in
the morning and see what we’ve done in the way
of spoiling their door, they may take us to another
room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use crossing a bridge until we come to
it,” Tom responded. “I’m going to get some
sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They ate a little of the food, and then, bracing
a chair under the knob of the door to prevent an
entrance without causing noise enough to arouse
them, the two threw themselves on the bed and
slept the sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faint daylight was struggling through the
barred window next morning when Tom awoke
and sat up. There was a peculiar noise for
which at first he could not account. He looked
toward the casement and then recognized the
dash of rain against the glass and heard the
roar of wind. It was this that caused the racket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned, turning
over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Big storm,” Tom answered. He jumped out
of bed and walked to the window. A moment
later he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s doing?” asked Ned, stretching lazily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those three fellows are down on the shore
doing something to their motorboat,” reported
Tom. “Looks as if it had been damaged in the
storm, which is a fierce one, let me tell you.
They seem to be making repairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe they’re going away and leave us
alone,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They may be going away,” assented Tom.
“But they won’t leave us, I’m thinking. They’ll
take us with them. But something evidently
has happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his eagerness to see what was going on at
the shore of the lake within view of the barred
window, Ned jumped out of bed. In doing so
he overbalanced himself and in order not to fall
he had to do a hop, skip and a jump across the
room. He brought up hard against the opposite
wall, fairly jarring the place. As he stopped
his somewhat mad and erratic career he uttered
a cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurt yourself?” asked Tom anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! But look! Man dear, look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned’s voice was excited, and no wonder! It
was evident that in his collision against the wall
he had struck a hidden spring which operated
the mechanism of a secret sliding door. For
there, before the eyes of the two captives, was
an opening, large enough for them to pass
through, in a stooping position, and leading to
the top of a flight of stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A secret door!” cried Tom. “How’d you
discover it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t,” Ned answered. “It just happened.
I bumped against the wall and must
have struck the spring. What’s it for, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the eyes of the young inventor shone a
new and hopeful light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what its original use was,” he
said slowly. “But for us it offers a way of escape.
Come on, Ned! We’ll light out while
those fellows are busy down at the boat. Grab
up some food and come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom began stuffing some bread and meat into
his pockets after hastily dressing, which was a
short operation, as the young men had not removed
all of their clothes the night before.
Then Tom took another look through the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re still tinkering over the motor,” he
reported. “It’s now or never, Ned! This
storm came just at the right time. Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we don’t know where that secret staircase
leads,” objected Ned Newton as he followed
his chum’s example about the food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it doesn’t make much difference, either.
It leads out of this room. That’s all we have to
know now. I think it must have been put in to
allow the secret removal of smuggled or stolen
goods—possibly bootleg liquor. Probably the
stairway ends in one of the rooms below. But
as those three scoundrels are out of the way we
can leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe we’ll be trapped at the bottom, Tom.
There must be a door there, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably there is; but it’s likely to be a sliding,
secret door, and, consequently, won’t be
very strong. We can burst it out, maybe.
Anyhow it’s worth trying. Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as the storm rose to new heights of
fury, the two prisoners slipped into the secret
opening and began descending the dark stairs
on their way to escape.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>RESCUED</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Using</span> the utmost caution, though they felt
quite certain their movements would be muffled
by the noise of the storm that raged about the
lonely house, Tom Swift and Ned Newton made
their way through the narrow, dark passage. It
was so low that they had to stoop and, as the
way was strange to them, Tom, who was in the
lead, proceeded carefully. He kept his hands
outstretched, one in front of him and the other
pressed against a side wall. Nor did he let his
weight bear on his feet when descending from
one step to another until he was sure it was firm
and solid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was not large, therefore the secret
stairway built in the walls could not be very
long. So in a comparatively short time, though
to the two young men it seemed long enough, the
inventor came to the end of the passage and
stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” whispered Ned, behind his chum,
after waiting impatiently for a short time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know whether it’s well or ill,” Tom
answered. “But I’ve come to a wall or a door
and I can find no means of opening it—if it is
a door. So we can’t go any farther without
breaking through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Burst it open, then!” advised Ned with
force. “We’ve got to get loose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s bound to make a noise,” Tom went on,
trying the second secret door by pushing on it,
thus determining that it was not of very solid
construction. “But I think the racket of the
storm will cover it. Are you ready for a dash?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” replied Ned. “We’re going to get
good and wet, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in the secret passage where they were
crouched, the noise of the storm came to them,
and it seemed to be increasing in fury. The
wind moaned, shrieked, and whistled around the
island house and the rain came down in rattling
sheets that played a tattoo on the sides and roof
of the building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here goes!” murmured Tom in a tense voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew back a little and when a sudden and
louder burst of the storm’s fury enveloped the
house, the young inventor hurled himself, back
foremost, against the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a crackling and splintering of wood
and Tom almost fell, so suddenly was he precipitated
through the broken door. Recovering
himself as best he could, Tom Swift saw that
he had come out into a small passageway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another door in front of him—an
ordinary one fastened with bolts in plain view,
and the passage was lighted by a window near
the ceiling. Ned followed his chum through
the broken secret door and the two stood for a
moment, listening for anything which might
indicate that their escape had been discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no sounds came to them save the noise of
the storm, more in evidence now that they were
closer to the outer air. Then Tom stepped to
the locked door and, pushing back the bolts,
swung it open. He had a momentary fear that
it might lead into another strong room, but, to
his own delighted surprise, as well as that of
Ned, it gave out of doors and a moment later
the two escaping captives stood in the wind and
rain beneath the forest trees, free!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was luck!” murmured Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we aren’t out of the woods yet,” replied
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was true in a double sense. The island
in Lake Carlopa was densely wooded, and, so far
as the young men knew, uninhabited save by the
unscrupulous men who had kidnapped them.
The sinister name of the place—Rattlesnake
Island—kept away many campers who otherwise
might have made the place popular. Perhaps,
years before, there had been many of the
deadly reptiles in the thickets, but it was doubtful
if many were there now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Tom and Ned did not give this a
thought. Their main idea was to get as far as
possible away from the house before Janner,
Snogg and Torpy discovered that the prisoners
had escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on!” murmured Tom, plunging off
into the rain-drenched woods, followed by Ned.
“They may be after us at any minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But evidently the scoundrels were too much
occupied with repairing their motorboat, for the
two escaping captives had a glimpse of the unsavory
trio grouped about it on the beach as
they threaded their way through the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew, but I’m getting wet!” gasped Ned,
as they crossed a little clearing and caught the
full force of the downpour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This storm was the best thing that could
happen to us,” Tom said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Except for the noise it made, the racket I
produced when I broke that door would have
given the alarm. Yes, this storm saved us.
Don’t mind a little wetting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little wetting!” good-naturedly chuckled
Ned. “This is about the biggest drenching I
ever saw—except when you went into the lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On they plunged, taking little heed of whither
they went so long as they put distance between
themselves and the three men. Then, when it
was evident there was to be no immediate pursuit,
they slackened their pace and began to
make plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are we going to do, Tom?” Ned asked,
pausing beneath a shelving ledge of rock that
afforded partial shelter from the dashing rain
and wind. “We’re still far from safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ought to get to the shore—as far away
from those fellows as we can—and signal some
passing boat. There ought to be plenty of craft
passing up and down the lake, though there’ll be
more after this storm lets up. We’ve got to get
back to the mainland. There’s no telling what
mischief this gang may be up to at my works.
The three scoundrels here are only part of the
crowd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you’re right there, Tom. A boat
headed for the mainland would just about suit
me now. I’d like to let my folks know I’m all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So should I,” agreed Tom. “Dad will be in
a fit when Koku and Mr. Damon go back and
tell him I fell overboard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have seen those fellows haul you
into their boat,” Ned suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally, they did. But that won’t make
dad feel any easier. Yes, we want to get back
home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, there seemed to be no prospect of
that in the immediate future. The storm continued
unabated and no boats passed Rattlesnake
Island, at least near the shore the two
captives dared approach. They might have
had better luck on the other side, for there lay
the usual channel, but the scoundrels’ motorboat
was there and the fugitives, therefore, must keep
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, Ned’s watch, which had not been
taken from him, indicated noon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” exclaimed the young manager when
he saw the time. “We ought to eat, Tom, and
get into some kind of shelter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s so,” agreed Tom, who was as miserable
as was his chum. “And if I’m not mistaken,
we passed some sort of a cave back there.
Let’s head for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to a small cavern under an overhanging
ledge of rock, and into this the two
wanderers gratefully crawled. They did not
explore to see how far back the cave extended,
but when they found some dry wood near the
entrance they built a fire and took off some of
their wet garments. As these were hung on
sticks near the blaze, to dry out, the young men,
sitting near the grateful heat, took out their
packages of food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily, they had wrapped the victuals in
waxed paper taken from some of the cracker
boxes supplied them for their first meal by their
captors. So that now the improvised lunch was
fairly dry. It was rather limited in its bill of
fare, however, and Tom and Ned would gladly
have parted with all the spare change in their
pockets for a cup of hot coffee. However, such
a luxury was beyond their reach, so they made
the best of what they had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain kept up all that afternoon, and once
the two were warm from their cave fire and their
garments fairly dry, they decided against venturing
out again into the downpour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may stop by morning,” Tom suggested,
“and by morning more boats will be out and
we’ll have a better chance of signaling one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Stay here all night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” chuckled Tom. “Do you know
a better place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You win!” agreed Ned. “We’ll camp out
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This they did, gathering some dried leaves
farther back in the cave, and in these they burrowed,
finding the warmth grateful from the
chill of the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was still raining in the morning, but not as
hard as before, when Tom and Ned awakened
and made a very light breakfast. Then, when
they were able to catch a glimpse of the sun,
which came out about an hour after they had
finished their limited meal, they again made a
trail toward the shore farthest removed from
the dock to which the scoundrels had tied up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They soon came out on a sandy beach and
into the full glare of a hot sun after the storm.
The cheering beams of Old Sol both warmed and
invigorated them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now if we can only see a boat we’ll be all
right,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did not have long to wait. A motor
craft came chugging into view and by dint of
shouts and the waving of Ned’s shirt, which that
young man gladly stripped off as a signal flag,
the man in the boat saw the castaways and
headed in toward them. The boatman proved
to be Gill Marsh, a fisherman for whom Tom
had more than once done favors, and Mr. Marsh
gladly agreed to take the young men to Shopton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though what you were doin’ on Rattlesnake
Island is more’n I can figger out,” said the mystified
Mr. Marsh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not very good at figuring, ourselves,
this morning,” said Tom, with a glance at Ned.
They saw no reason for telling what had happened
until they had had a chance to capture the
scoundrels, for to attempt this they were determined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a short time they were landed at a dock not
far from the Swift shops, and Tom was soon in
telephonic communication with Mr. Jackson,
who was both surprised and delighted to hear
from his missing employer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned’s safe, too!” Tom said. “Get word to
his folks as soon as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’ll do, Mr. Swift!” said the
shop superintendent. “But where have you
been? We’ve had the police for miles around
looking for you two. What happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a long story. I’ll tell you later,” Tom
said. “But how are things at the shop?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ve had some trouble, and that fellow
Greenbaum——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there, to Tom’s disgust, the connection
was broken, nor, do what he would to attract the
operator, could he restore it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to hurry back, Ned!” exclaimed
the young inventor. “Those scoundrels are still
at their tricks!”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>GREENBAUM THREATENS</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>More</span> than ever anxious, as much by what
Mr. Jackson had left unsaid as by what had
come to him over the wire before the interruption,
Tom Swift hailed a taxicab and in it rode
to his home, stopping, since it was on his way,
to let Ned Newton off at the latter’s home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk too much—outside your own family
circle—of what happened, Ned,” was the
warning Tom gave his chum as they parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t. But you aren’t going to let the
matter drop here, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say not! But I want to swoop
down on those fellows before they know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom found his father excited by the sudden
news over his son’s safety, but it was a joyous
reaction after the dismal news brought back by
Mr. Damon and Koku, following the episode
of the motorboat chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened after I left you?” Tom
asked Mr. Damon, who had been pretty constantly
at the Swift home following the kidnapping
of the young inventor and his manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After you <i>left</i> us?” repeated the eccentric
man somewhat dazedly. “You mean——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean after I fell overboard,” said Tom,
with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. Well, neither Koku nor I knew
how to manage the <i>Gull</i>, and your friend Bill
Tagg wasn’t any better off, bless my rudder!”
said Mr. Damon. “So we just let her run, and
she slued around so much and acted so queerly
after you were taken aboard the other boat that
some fellows in a sailboat came to our aid. We
told them what had happened—without going
too much into your private affairs, Tom—and
one of the men got aboard the <i>Gull</i> and brought
us back to the dock where we started from.
Then I hurried here to tell your father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I got in touch with the police,” said
Mr. Swift, taking up the story, “for I guessed
that those aboard that other boat were your enemies,
Tom. But the police didn’t know where
to look. So what with you gone and nothing
heard of Ned, we were in a great stew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can imagine it,” Tom said. “Of course
you had no way of really knowing Ned was
aboard the other boat, though I suppose from
what happened and the sight of the bound figure
in the bottom of the <i>Turtle</i>, you might have
guessed Ned was aboard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I surmised it,” assented Mr. Damon. “But
we had no idea where they were taking you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you couldn’t know that,” said Tom.
“Well, we got away from the scoundrels, and
the next thing is to catch them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having given his father and Mr. Damon a
hasty description of what had happened to him
and Ned, Tom Swift set about the work of running
down the miscreants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The police were notified of the return of the
young inventor, and a squad of officers was sent
to Rattlesnake Island. Tom did not go, for he
felt the need of rest. Besides, there were things
at home which needed his attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it you started to tell me when we
were cut off, Mr. Jackson?” Tom asked his superintendent
after the police had departed for
the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean about Greenbaum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Is he still here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he is, Mr. Swift; and I hope I’m not
going against your wishes when I say I wish he
wasn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, Mr. Jackson. I have no desire
to keep that man if he isn’t doing what is right,
though I must admit that he is a good workman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you there. But after what happened
you must use your own judgment about
keeping him on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he and I quarreled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did Greenbaum do?” Tom asked. He
knew he need not ask what his superintendent
had done, for Garret Jackson was thoroughly
dependable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I found him sneaking around your private
room, Tom—the room where you have been doing
those experiments of late. I don’t know
what they are and I don’t want to know until
the right time comes. But I felt pretty sure
you didn’t want Greenbaum to be prying in
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more I do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I thought. So when I saw him
come out of that room the second time, after you
had gone to find Ned, I called him to account
for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you told him to go in there to experiment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was untrue!” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I guessed. So I took the liberty of putting
a new lock on the place—a lock that fellow
couldn’t pick if he wanted to, and he came at me
hot and heavy. We had a quarrel, and I’m glad
you’re here to settle it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ll settle it mighty quick!” exclaimed
Tom. He was in his private office now, in a
part of the shop somewhat removed from his
secret experimental laboratory. Pushing a button
that summoned a messenger, Tom bade the
boy send Greenbaum in. And when the man
sauntered in, smiling and seeming very confident
of himself, the young inventor said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get your time from the cashier and pack
your things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?” demanded Greenbaum, with a
quick change of countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you’re through here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through, Mr. Swift! Why, you gave me a
contract and you can’t fire me off-hand this way
without telling me why! It isn’t fair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s fair enough, and you know it!” declared
Tom. “The only contract you had was that I
said I’d keep you as long as your work was satisfactory.
Well, it isn’t. It’s far from satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean on that magnetic gear shift? I
can show you, Mr. Swift, that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t the gear shift. I’m going to drop
that. It’s your own private work of trying to
sneak in and fathom my secrets. That’s all.
You are through. Get your time and clear out!
Mr. Jackson was right in his surmise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so Jackson has been talking about me,
has he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not answering any of your questions,”
retorted Tom. “The sooner you leave the
premises the better. And don’t come back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Greenbaum stood looking
squarely at Tom Swift whose eyes never faltered
under the gaze of the angry man. Then Greenbaum
asked with great deliberation:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that your last word, Mr. Swift?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all I’ve got to say is that maybe you’ll
be sorry for this some day! Maybe you’ll be
sorry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a distinct threat in Greenbaum’s
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” cried Tom in anger
starting from his chair. “How dare you threaten
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Greenbaum made no answer, but turned and
went out of the office. Tom was about to follow,
for he did not want the fellow to think he could
thus defy him, when the telephone on the desk
rang out sharply.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>MR. DAMON DANCES</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“Hello!</span> Hello!” the young inventor called
into the transmitter. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not recognize the voice at first, but the
speaker soon identified himself as Joe Corrigan,
the officer in charge of the squad of men who
had gone to Rattlesnake Island in an endeavor
to apprehend the three men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they had flew the coop, Mr. Swift,” reported
Joe Corrigan. “Not hide nor hair of ’em
on the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you find the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, sure! And we saw where you and Mr.
Newton broke out. But the men must have
skipped right after they found you had got
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so. What about their boat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No trace of that, either. I’m sorry we didn’t
get ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly thought you would—it was just a
chance,” Tom retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’re not going to give up,” declared
Corrigan. “We’ll catch ’em yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had his doubts on this subject, but he
did not express them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wish you lots of luck!” he called over the
wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was sure, however, that Snogg, Janner and
Torpy were but the tools in the hands of more
powerful men, men who would keep themselves
well hidden, and that though the ruffians might
be apprehended in time, little or nothing would
be learned from them. They would take the
blame and say nothing of the men who had hired
them, probably being well paid for any punishment
they might suffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, so much for that,” said Tom when he
had ruminated over what Corrigan had reported.
“Now about Greenbaum. That’s more serious. I
can’t let him get away with threatening me like
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, when Tom hurried out to intercept
Greenbaum he found that the fellow had packed
his belongings and hurried away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was quick work,” reflected Tom.
Then, as he thought the matter over, he was
pretty sure that Greenbaum had anticipated
what was coming to him and had accordingly
made his arrangements for a speedy departure.
“I only hope he didn’t get into the laboratory to
do more damage to my talking-picture machine
before he lighted out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was reassured, however, when he found
Koku on guard at the door of the laboratory
which still needed a bit of work to restore it to
the spick-and-span condition it was in before
the explosion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did anybody try to get in here just now,
Koku?” asked Tom, thinking the giant might
have prevented Greenbaum from a last and dangerous
call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody come right away,” the giant reported.
“But yesterday him try come in and
Mr. Jackson say I to stay here. So Koku stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the idea!” exclaimed Tom approvingly.
“Don’t let any one in here except my
father, Ned Newton or me—not even Mr. Jackson
for a while. Those scoundrels might get
hold of my superintendent and try to torture
something out of him if they thought he knew,”
Tom said to himself. “It’s best to keep the
secret among as few as possible until I’m ready
to spring it. I want you to guard this place
well, Koku,” went on Tom. “Especially at
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me guard!” grunted the giant. “Nobody git
past without me punch him—but no punch you,
Master, nor Mr. Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, please don’t punch us, or my father,”
begged Tom, with a smile. Well he knew the
weight of that mighty fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking it not worth while to follow the
man, Tom posted a notice to the effect that
Greenbaum had been discharged and gave orders
that he was not again to be admitted to the
works on any pretext.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the last few years the Swift plant had
been surrounded by a high and strong fence,
which was further defended against marauders
by electrically charged wires. These wires did
not carry a high enough current, under ordinary
circumstances, to cause death, but the shock
they could administer to unauthorized persons
seeking to gain admittance was severe enough to
deter them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having seen to the safety of the plant in general,
Tom, after telephoning to Ned the result
of the police visit to Rattlesnake Island, began
to prepare for the resumption of work on his
talking-picture apparatus. It was not long before
the destroyed parts had been remade and
he was about ready to start experimenting
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Ned,” said Tom to his helper one day
about two weeks after their strenuous experiences,
“are you ready to be an actor again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean in the song and dance line—trying
to make my voice and image come through solid
walls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the idea. I have my machine set
up again after the explosion, and I think I’m
nearer the solution than ever before. I’ve made
a lot of changes. In a way, the fire and blast
didn’t mean such a total loss, after all. It
helped put me on a new track.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good. Well, I’m ready for you as
soon as I get this statement off to the bank.
What’s the idea, Tom, borrowing so much money
on notes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got to have it, Ned,” and the young inventor
seemed a bit put out by the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it for this new invention?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, why not sell some of your securities?
Money is high now, and to borrow it I’ve got to
make statements to the bank that disclose a lot
of your private dealings. Of course, they’re in
safe hands, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead and get the money, Ned. We’ll
need all that and more. I’ve sunk a lot in this
invention, but I’ll get it all back again, and more
too. No use spoiling the ship for a pennyworth
of tar, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know, Tom. And if you’re sure
you’re on the right track——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m never sure of anything in this world,
Ned. But I know one thing, if I don’t pull out
of this a winner, the banks will be asking a lot
more questions than they have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As bad as that?” asked Ned, struck by his
friend’s serious manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As bad—or as good. It depends on how you
look at it. But I’ll leave the finances to you.
I’m going to try out some new ideas now as soon
as you can get into the broadcasting room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom called the room where Ned did his acting
under the battery of electric lights his “broadcasting
studio.” In a measure this was what
it was, for vocal sounds and instrumental music
were broadcast from it in the manner familiar
to all who own a radio set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what Tom was trying to do, and which
he found not at all easy, was to broadcast the
sight of Ned and the song, making sight and
sound synchronized. He wanted to perfect a
radio receiver with an added apparatus by
which, on a screen attached to the sounding
cabinet, a person could view the person or persons
doing the singing, dancing, or whatever
form of activity was being presented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This of course was not to be confounded with
some moving and “talking” pictures, which are
a combination of films and phonograph records,
working simultaneously. By Tom’s machine,
when perfected, one would be enabled to see and
hear an actual theater play, a complete vaudeville
show, or even a complete operatic performance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ned finished his financial work he went
to the studio and there he remained until far
into the night while Tom, in his laboratory,
watched the metallic glass screen and changed
and adjusted switches, eliminators, tubes and
different forms of electrical currents, endeavoring
to capture not only Ned’s voice but his
image.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how did it go, Tom?” asked Ned, coming
to the laboratory after a bell signal told him
work for the night was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somewhat better, I’m glad to say. I could
see you much more plainly. Your voice was
very clear. It’s only the vision apparatus that
needs improving. How did you make out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t mind it. But why did you send
some one to look through the windows at
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look through the windows at you?” exclaimed
Tom. “I didn’t! You must be dreaming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I’m not. Two or three times, while
I was singing and dancing, I saw faces peering
in at me. I thought you had some men checking
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed!” cried Tom. “Ned, I believe
the spies are at work again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seemed very possible when the two compared
notes. Though Koku on guard outside
the laboratory had reported no suspicious persons
around, this much could not be said of the
room where Ned performed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll guard that, too!” decided Tom, and the
next time when a “show” was put on, Eradicate
was on duty to see that no one approached the
windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who the unbidden spectators could have been
Tom had no idea, but he guessed they were
emissaries from the men seeking to discover his
secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the days went on Tom Swift became more
and more convinced that he was being closely
watched by men who had a vital reason for discovering
his secret. That these men were those
interested in moving pictures and theatrical
shows was certain. Tom realized what it would
mean if their form of entertainment could be
presented in even the humblest home in connection
with the broadcasting of music, once his
invention was successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one night when Ned had been performing
a long time and when the results were not as
satisfactory as at first that Tom, sinking wearily
back in his chair and wondering what was wrong,
heard a commotion in the corridor outside his
private laboratory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No go in! No go in!” Koku’s big voice
boomed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! Of course I’m going in!” another
voice responded. “Bless my toothbrush,
but I want to see Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on in, Mr. Damon!” called out the
young inventor, as a new and daring idea came
to him. “It’s all right, Koku,” he went on to
the giant. “Let Mr. Damon in. Look here,”
said Tom, addressing his eccentric friend, “can
you sing and dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—bless—well, I don’t know, Tom. I
used to,” and Mr. Damon chuckled. “I once
was given to taking part in amateur minstrels.
But is this a joke or a serious question?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s serious business. Just as you came
along I happened to think that perhaps what I
need at the visual sending end is a contrast of
color. That might solve the problem, the difference
in light rays—red at one end of the spectrum
and violet at the other. It’s worth trying.
But I need two performers. Ned’s in there
now. He has on a violet suit—regular clown’s
outfit. Will you put on a red one and help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do anything, Tom, but eat onions. I
hate ’em! Never could touch the things. So
outside of that I’m at your service. I just
stopped in casually on my way home and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re just in time!” interrupted Tom.
“This thing is giving me the dingbats, or it will
if I don’t solve it soon. Come on, I’ll have to
pass you in, for Eradicate is on guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned, who was resting after his singing and
dancing, attired in a violet-colored suit, as Tom
had said, welcomed Mr. Damon. Tom quickly
explained his new plan, and when Koku and
Eradicate had made sure no interlopers were
around, the new experiments were begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s it all about?” asked Mr. Damon
as, in his red suit, he joined Ned in the song and
dance. It may be said, in passing, that Mr.
Damon was much funnier than he suspected.
In spite of his anxiety over the outcome, Tom
could not help chuckling as he watched the little
rehearsal before going back to his laboratory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll do excellently,” he said, as he observed
his eccentric friend shuffle about the improvised
stage. “Keep it up now, and I’ll see
how it comes through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the glare of the powerful lights in
the broadcasting studio, Mr. Damon and Ned
danced and sang while with an anxious heart
Tom Swift hurried back to the laboratory to
see if the faint image on the metallic glass screen
was any brighter.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>KOKU IS DRUGGED</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> young inventor, hastening along the corridor
between his broadcasting studio and the
laboratory where the new machine was set up,
passed the giant Koku who sat on a stool not
far from Tom’s door. Here the big man had
taken his place each night while the testing was
going on. With him on guard, Tom felt secure
against intrusion by any of the plotters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Getting tired, Koku?” asked Tom, pausing
on the threshold of his laboratory. “It isn’t
much fun for you to be sitting there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much tired. Master,” was the reply,
“But Koku like do something—smash somebody—fight.
No fun sit here nodding do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t much fun doing nothing, I’ll admit,”
said Tom. “And if it ever comes to a
fight, Koku, you shall have a share in it. But it
looks now as though the rascals would leave us
alone. It won’t be much longer now, I think,
I’m on the verge of success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That good,” Koku answered. He did not,
perhaps, understand all Tom had said, but he
had been associated with the young inventor
long enough to know when Tom spoke of success
that it meant pleasure for the “Master.” For
this Koku was glad. “Maybe you make new
airship go back Koku’s country?” the giant
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, this isn’t an airship I’m working on
now,” Tom said, knowing it would be of no use
to explain to the simple mind of the giant what
the invention really was. “But would you like
to go back to your own land of giants, Koku?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes Koku think maybe he like to go,”
was the slow answer. “But Koku like it here,
too. Sometimes get hungry for fash,” and he
named a peculiar fruit that the giants of his land
were especially fond of. Tom and Ned, on their
voyage which had resulted in the capture of
Koku, had seen how passionately eager the big
men were for this fruit. They would go to almost
any length to get it. And Tom had an
idea how Koku must long for some now and
then in a land where no fash was to be had. It
Was a species of melon with a peculiar taste and
odor. Neither Tom nor Ned had any liking for
fash, but the giants seemed to thrive upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some day, Koku,” the young inventor half
promised as he stepped into his laboratory to
start anew the test, this time under different circumstances,
“I may take another airship trip to
your country and let you have all the fash you
want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By golly, Master, that be good time for me!”
cried the giant with a happy laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tom walked over to the apparatus by
which he hoped to produce such startling results,
the telephone bell on the instrument that
connected the laboratory with the broadcasting
studio rang hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello! What’s the matter?” Tom asked,
over the wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long do you want us to keep at this
thing?” asked the laughing voice of Ned Newton.
“I—oh, dear—whew—I can’t stand this
much longer, Tom!” and he went off into another
fit of merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what’s the matter?” asked the wondering
inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s my partner in the red suit!” chuckled
Ned. “He’s cutting up such funny antics
that I can’t dance or sing for laughing. How
is it coming through?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t connected up yet,” Tom answered.
“I will in a minute. I was talking to Koku.
He’s hungry for fash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For fash!” exclaimed Ned wonderingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Don’t you remember those peculiar
melons that had such a funny smell and taste?
The giants were crazy about them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” Ned answered. “I’d forgotten all
about them. But get on with the show. I happen
to have a date with Helen to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll soon release you,” promised Tom. “So
Mr. Damon is cutting loose, is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to see him!” chuckled the other
performer, and even then Tom caught, over the
telephone, snatches of comic songs Mr. Damon
was practicing—recollections of his amateur
minstrel days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right—get set!” advised the inventor.
“I’m going to turn on the power now. Keep
toward the middle of the stage, for I haven’t got
a very wide screen and the focus is narrow. If
you get too far to either side I may lose the image
and can’t tell whether I’m getting you or
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” was the succinct answer of Ned.
Then Tom made the adjustments, turned on the
power, and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later there came from his loud
speaker the tones of Ned and Mr. Damon singing
a selection from one of the latest comic
operas. The musical accompaniment came
from an electrical piano in the studio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the best and clearest broadcasting
I’ve gotten yet!” said Tom, with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s the easiest part of it. Now will the
images of the performers come on the screen
clearly? That’s the decisive test.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anxiously, he turned the switch that controlled
the projection of moving objects. There
was a hissing sound, a slight humming, and then
a soft glow illuminated the metallic glass screen
in front of Tom Swift. It suffused to a milky
whiteness and then, as upon the silver screen in
a moving picture theater, but in miniature size,
there was projected before Tom’s eyes the figures
of Ned and Mr. Damon going through the movements
of an eccentric dance as they sang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Tom wanted to shout in delight,
for, perhaps due to the fact that the performers
wore contrasting garments of red and
violet, the images projected were clearer than
any Tom had yet succeeded in getting through
by means of his new wireless apparatus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I’ve struck it!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he began to laugh, for Mr. Damon certainly
was funny. He even seemed to know
that Tom, in a distant room, could see him, for
the odd man winked one eye and made gestures
at Tom as though the young inventor were personally
before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Ha!” chuckled Tom. “I must get dad
in to see this. He’ll believe in it now.” For,
up to this time, Mr. Swift had been rather skeptical,
though he was fully in sympathy with
Tom’s aims. “And I’d like to show it to Mary,”
mused the young inventor, as he sat there enjoying
what really was a team vaudeville sketch
without either of the artists being in the room
with him. Their song, the music, and even the
shuffling of their feet came plainly to him
through the loud speaker, while the image was
shimmering on the metallic glass screen almost
as plainly as though Tom had been in the studio.
Of course the image was in reduced size. The
screen was about three feet square, and life-sized
figures cannot be shown on that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in time I can get them full size,” Tom
decided. “Oh, but this is good! I can see success
now, though it still must be a little clearer
to make it a positive thing and in natural
colors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he bethought him that Ned and Mr.
Damon must be tired, for they had been keeping
steadily at it for nearly an hour while Tom
tried different combinations of lights and currents
of various intensities in order to get the
best effects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess I’ll ’phone them that they can let up
now,” decided the young inventor. “They must
be tired. And Ned wants to go see Helen. By
the same token I’d better give Mary a call, I
guess. I’ve been rather neglecting her of late—too
busy over this invention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then another thought came to Tom—that he
would have the girls and perhaps their parents
come to the studio to take a look at the result
he had accomplished. True, it was not yet perfected;
but he knew his friends would keep his
secret until he could complete the patent applications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ll give the girls a show,” decided Tom.
“They sure will enjoy Mr. Damon’s singing and
dancing. Gosh, but he’s funny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom shut off the power. The image faded
from the screen which turned from milky whiteness
to the blackness of pitch. Then the voices
of the performers died away as Tom cut off the
radio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about to step to the telephone to advise
his friends of his almost complete success
and to tell them to cease their efforts when a
noise out in the corridor attracted his attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe they’ve decided to quit of their own
accord,” mused Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened the door of his laboratory and
stepped into the hall. He saw nothing of Ned
or Mr. Damon approaching and at once became
aware of a peculiar odor. At first he
could not account for it, thinking, for a moment,
that his father might be at work in the chemical
laboratory farther down the corridor. But after
a second deep breath Tom knew it was no chemical
he smelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It—it’s—fash!” he murmured. “The peculiar
melon fruit that Koku was wishing for. But
how in the world could that smell get here?
There isn’t any fash within hundreds of miles—yes,
even thousands! How Koku could get
any——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused. There was a dark object on the
floor near where the giant had been sitting on
guard. Tom switched on a brilliant overhead
light. It illuminated the place where Koku had
been sitting, but the giant was no longer in his
chair. He was sprawled on the floor, an inert
lump of flesh, while, not far from him, was one
of those peculiar melons, or fash fruits, of which
the giants of that far-off, strange land were so
fond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I be dreaming?” gasped Tom. “How
did this happen? Koku must be drugged!
How did he get that fash? And what does it
all mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he started forward a noise behind him attracted
his attention.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A SINISTER WARNING</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Like</span> an electrical flash it came into the mind
of Tom Swift that there was something wrong
here—something terribly and dangerously
wrong. The drugged giant—nothing less than
a drug could account for the helplessness of
Koku—the appearance of that strange fruit, the
noise behind—all these were warnings not to be
ignored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, though his first impulse was to hasten to
the aid of the giant, when he heard that noise
back of him Tom turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was only just in time. He had a glimpse
of a figure gliding toward him out of the shadows,
for that part of the corridor was not
brightly lighted. And the figure was that of
the man lately discharged—Greenbaum!</p>

<p class='pindent'>With uplifted hand, in which was some sort
of a weapon Tom could not distinguish, Greenbaum
glided toward him. Tom was taken so
by surprise and was so off his guard because of
what had happened to Koku that he might have
fallen a victim to Greenbaum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at that moment occurred an interruption
and a diversion that saved the situation,
and perhaps Tom’s life. The door farther down
the corridor opened and Mr. Damon and Ned,
preceded by Eradicate, who had been serving as
guard there, came out. The two performers, receiving
no answer to their telephonic signal, had
rightly concluded that Tom had finished experimenting
for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the same time I thought something might
be wrong when you didn’t answer,” Ned explained
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At any rate, the two performers and Eradicate
were now hastening toward the young inventor.
In a trice they realized that Tom was
about to be attacked. But before the knife in
Greenbaum’s hand could descend, the man received
some missile full in the face with such
crashing force that he staggered back. He
dropped the knife, and with a cry of pain darted
away, being lost to sight in the shadows of the
hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good shot!” cried Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my rubber boot, Eradicate hit the
scoundrel with a shoe!” exclaimed Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s whut I done!” chuckled the negro. “I
didn’t have nothin’ else, so I tuck off mah shoe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eradicate had big feet and wore heavy brogans,
so the hobnailed sole and heel made as effective
a weapon for the purpose as could be
desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recovering from the astonishment into which
the unexpected attempt on his life had thrown
him, Tom Swift turned about and darted into
the lower part of the hall in pursuit of Greenbaum.
But he was too late. The slight start
which the man had, served him in good stead
and he made his escape. Though Tom sounded
the alarm and got many of his night watchmen
on the job, they could not capture the intruder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not until it was made certain that he was no
longer on the premises did Tom turn his attention
to Koku. Eradicate, however, had begun
to minister to his fellow guard. Though there
was jealousy between the two because each one
desired to serve Tom alone, when one was in
trouble the other always showed a friendly
spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody done chlo’fo’m him!” was Eradicate’s
opinion, when Tom and Ned came back
from the unsuccessful chase after Greenbaum,
to find the giant just recovering consciousness.
There was a dazed look on his face, but his eyes
opened wider as he saw the fash melon on the
floor near where he had fallen from his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Koku no dream then,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened?” asked Tom, when he had
sent several men to find out, if possible, how
Greenbaum had eluded the guard and the electrically
charged fence and so had gained entrance
to the private laboratory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the giant, whose immense bulk was proof
against any ordinary means of making him unconscious,
told what had taken place. He had
been sitting in his chair on guard near Tom’s
door after the little talk he had with the young
inventor about his desire to have a fash melon
once more. Then, as Koku explained it, a little
later, there came rolling along the corridor
toward his chair one of the very same fruits for
which he had such a longing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a transport of joy at the sight and smell
of the dainty, not stopping to consider how
strange it was that the fruit should have appeared
at such an opportune time, Koku stooped
to pick it up. But he never got his hands on
it, so he said, for a moment later he “went to
sleep,” as he expressed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were drugged,” declared Tom. “Whoever
rolled that fash in to attract your attention
and keep you from being suspicious,
whoever did that, must have sprayed some
chloroform or ether up your nose. You went
down and out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so, Master,” admitted the giant
humbly. “Koku very sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Greenbaum brought it,” declared Tom. “He
wanted to get Koku out of the way and then he
thought he’d get me. Guess he didn’t count on
Ned and Mr. Damon being so near.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t figure on Eradicate’s shoe, either,”
chuckled Mr. Damon. “Bless my trolley fare,
but that was a good shot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But look here,” persisted Ned. “It’s all
right enough for you to say that Greenbaum
brought that fash here to tempt Koku. So much
is evident and plain. What isn’t plain is how
Greenbaum knew about the fash and where he
got it. That’s what puzzles me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a small problem compared to the others
we have to solve,” said Tom, with a serious
look on his face. “What worries me is how
Greenbaum passed the guard lines. It also worries
me to know that the men who seem bent on
preventing me from completing this invention
are still on my trail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are greater problems,” agreed Ned.
“Very likely we are wrong in thinking these peculiar
melons grow only in Koku’s country.
This may have come from South America or
Africa in a shipment of fruit. You know we
get pears, or maybe it’s peaches I’m thinking of—anyhow,
it’s something, from Australia. And
if they can ship things that far, it wouldn’t be
impossible to bring fash from where we got
Koku. Only what puzzles me is how anybody
knew of these melons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll consider that later,” suggested Tom.
“But it occurs to me that the moving picture
people have of late been sending men into all
sorts of strange countries for travel news. It is
entirely within the bounds of reason to suppose
that some of them have penetrated to the land
where Koku came from and where the fash
grows. Some exploring movie men may have
brought a few of the melons back with him.
You know Koku said they keep an astonishingly
long time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Ned. “But that one won’t keep
long,” he added, with a chuckle, for the giant
was already opening his big pocket knife preparatory
to cutting the melon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in here, Koku, if you please,” said Tom,
motioning to the giant to go outside to cut the
fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had a disagreeable odor when whole, but
the aroma was tripled when the fash was cut.
Koku had speedily recovered from the effects
of the drug and was preparing for a feast. If
Tom had been a few minutes later in opening his
door, the giant might have been dead and the
young inventor himself would have been in grave
danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let Koku enjoy his fash,” Tom said as
the big man went out into the night with his
treasure, having first, however, offered to share
it with his master. The offer was politely
turned down. “We’ve got to investigate what
happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They could not find out how Greenbaum got
in, and Tom began to fear there was still another
spy in his working force. He resolved to have
a strict inquiry next morning and made a note
to charge Mr. Jackson with this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how did the talking-picture work, Tom?”
asked Ned when they were ready to close the laboratory
and disperse for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine! Almost perfect! I’m on the verge
of success!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why those plotters are getting desperate,
I guess,” suggested the manager.
“They’re out to do you, Tom. Better clean
this thing up and sell it. Then they’ll let you
alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m thinking of that. But I want to make
one more demonstration and have Mary, Helen,
and some of their folks see it. There are one or
two little improvements that occur to me that
can be made, and then I’ll be ready for a final
showing before I get my last patents. After
that I’ll be ready to market my invention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to give a sort of dress rehearsal?”
asked Ned, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A search next morning revealed little more
than had been found out the night before. Nor
was the strict inquiry the superintendent conducted
fruitful of results. No spies were uncovered
among Tom’s factory forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, omitting no precautions, the young inventor
took even greater pains to insure privacy
in his personal laboratory. There he worked
hard to perfect his invention, taking hardly any
sleep for a week, so that he was almost exhausted.
His father and Ned helped and so did
Mr. Damon. Koku and Eradicate were kept on
guard, and the giant, having satisfied his longing
for fash, declared that he would not move
from his chair again to pick up a dozen of the
odorous melons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, laboring hard, Tom brought to what he
thought would be perfection his newest invention.
Mr. Swift was greatly interested in it,
though he begged his son to proceed cautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You evidently have powerful enemies, Tom,”
said the aged man. “They must think you will
ruin part of their business in moving pictures
and theatrical performances and that is why
they are so anxious to get you out of the way.
Be careful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” promised the young man. “But they
can’t stop me now. Success is just across the
line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had entirely rebuilt the machine after the
fire and blast, and it was larger and better than
ever. Mary and Helen, with their families, had
been taken into Tom’s confidence and he had
promised them that they should see and hear
the performance of Ned and Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s quite thrilling!” said Mary, with a fond
look at Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you’ll say so after the demonstration,”
was his answer. “I may ask you and Helen to
perform, also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’ll be glad to,” said Helen. “I can’t
let Ned get away with all the honors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the day on which the final demonstration
was to take place. Tom had arranged his
apparatus and had invited the two girls and
their families to come to the laboratory for the
evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the afternoon, about six hours before the
time set, Tom was in his workroom putting some
finishing touches to the machinery and testing
the electrical wires when he heard Eradicate
coming along the corridor. Something in the
colored man’s step and the fact that he was muttering
excitedly to himself, roused Tom’s curiosity
and fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Rad?” he asked, opening
the door in response to the faithful black
man’s knock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man jest give me dis,” answered Eradicate,
holding out a letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out in de yard,” was the answer. “I was
walkin’ round like yo’ done tole me watchin’ fo’
strangers, when de man come up an’ handed me
dis. He were a stranger—I was goin’ to tell
him to make his se’f skurse when he done hand
me dat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eradicate nodded toward the note which Tom
held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he say anything when he gave it to
you?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He say ‘gib dat to Tom Swift. It may be
life or death to him,’ ” quoted Eradicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom hastily tore open the envelope. As he
read the message a cry of rage and astonishment
came to his lips.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A STARTLING DISCOVERY</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“What’s</span> the matter?” asked Ned Newton.
He had been making the broadcasting studio
ready for the performance he and Mr. Damon
would soon give in there, so Tom could show
his assembled party of guests what the new invention
would do. “What’s wrong, Tom?” he
asked again, entering the laboratory just as his
chum finished reading the sinister message that
Eradicate had handed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wrong is the word,” murmured Tom, again
reading the warning. “What do you think of
that?” and he handed the paper to his financial
manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned scanned the scrawl—it was only that—words
hastily scribbled on a piece of wrapping
paper and enclosed in a dirty envelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” whistled Ned as he read. And this
is what his eyes took in:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom Swift: If you exhibit your new talking
pictures your whole plant will be blown to
atoms. Take warning in time.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no name signed to it,” remarked
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There doesn’t need be,” responded his chum.
“It’s easy to guess that this comes from the same
crowd who kidnapped you and me—the same
men who tried to blow me up. There’s no need
for a name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I guess you’re right,” Ned agreed.
“Still, if we could trace these fellows——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m going to try!” exclaimed Tom. “I’m
not going to sit idly down and let them think
they have us scared. Eradicate, show me just
where you met this man and tell me what he
looked like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The negro did his best, but he was getting old
and his memory was not what it had been. He
gave a rather hazy description of the bearer of
the sinister warning, but he was able to point out
the place where he had come upon the intruder.
Intruder was exactly what the messenger was,
for, since beginning work on his latest invention,
Tom had taken precautions to admit none
but his own men to the plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He met me heah,” said Eradicate pointing to
a clump of bushes near the electrically charged
fence. That is, it was electrically charged at
night. During the day, when many watchmen
were on the alert, Tom did not have the current
turned on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m going to have it on after this,” he
decided, when a search of the grounds in the
vicinity of the place where Eradicate had received
the note revealed no one. “He must
have gotten over the fence in some way, didn’t
he, Rad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t see him shinny ober de fence, no,
Massa Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I think he must have come in that way.
Where did he go after he left the note with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He jes’ disappeared, dat’s whut he done!
He jes’ vanished like!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must be a voodoo man,” suggested Ned
jokingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eradicate’s eyes grew round and his jaw
dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Tom glancing warningly at Ned,
“what I think happened was that when Rad was
looking at the note and trying to adjust himself
to the life or death twist the fellow gave to it, the
scoundrel jumped back over the fence before
Rad saw him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d have to be a pretty good jumper to get
over this fence,” Ned commented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but it could be done,” said Tom. “But
from now on the electric current will be on duty
twenty-four hours a day. I’ll put a stop to this
nonsense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m going to take no chances, for one
thing,” was the reply. “I don’t know whether
this message is genuine or a hoax. But I can’t
afford to take any chances. There are too many
men in this plant to risk having even one of the
smaller buildings blown up. If only my own
laboratory were involved I wouldn’t think so
much of it. Though of course a lot of damage
could be done to my new invention now that it’s
practically finished. However, we’ll have the
most thorough investigation possible. I’ll shut
down work for the rest of the day and turn the
force into an investigating body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s a wise thing to do,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later the big factory whistle sounded
the signal of alarm. Men dropped their tools,
shut down their machines, and gathered at the
appointed places. It was as if, on a ship, the
signal had been given for boat drill. Tom had
organized his men this way to respond to the
alarm in case of emergency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a short time several hundred indignant
employees of the Swift Construction Company
were listening to Tom tell of the latest outrage.
He did not need to go into details of his secret
invention which, until it was perfected, he would
not give to the world. It was enough to state
that enemies were trying to intimidate the head
of the firm in an endeavor to steal some of the
valuable secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be a spy and traitor among us,”
declared Tom. “I doubt that. But there is
some way for my enemies to gain entrance to
the plant that I can’t discover. Now I want
you to go over the place. Look for a secret
means of entering. Look for hidden wires that
may connect with planted mines. In short, go
over the plant with a fine toothed comb and let
me know what you find.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what we’ll do, Mr. Swift!” came the
reassuring chorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if we find any of the scoundrels we’ll
string ’em up!” yelled one enthusiastic and indignant
workman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t do anything rash or unlawful!”
warned the young inventor. “Make any intruder
you catch a prisoner and bring him to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men scattered to make a thorough search,
and then Tom went into his private laboratory
where his father and Ned had preceded him.
He wanted to talk the situation over with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think, Dad?” asked Tom, when
he had related to his parent the latest attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” was the careful answer, “to me it looks
like a deep-laid plot against you. They don’t
want you to put these talking pictures on the
market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how is it their business?” asked Ned.
“I mean the business of whoever is doing these
tricks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It concerns them vitally,” replied Mr. Swift.
“Why, just think what it would mean if a whole
theatrical performance could be thrown on the
screen in private homes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’m going to make possible!”
declared the young inventor. “Those who buy
my machine will not only hear but, on the screen
attached to the apparatus, they will see the performers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may mean ruin to many regular theaters
and moving picture houses, Tom,” warned Mr.
Swift. “Those people have millions of dollars
invested in their projects. They evidently mean
business,” and he tapped the warning letter
Eradicate had received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they mean business; but so do I!” cried
Tom in a ringing voice. “The question is who
means the most business. You don’t want me
to quit, do you, Dad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Tom, I can’t say I do. Yet I want you
to be careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your idea, Ned? Should I knuckle
under to these scoundrels and tell them I’ll
throw overboard the machine I’ve been working
on so hard for the last year? Shall I admit I’m
beaten?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Ned Newton did not answer.
Then something of Tom’s ringing spirit was
communicated and, banging his fist on the table
with such force that he knocked over a rack of
test tubes, the manager cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Tom! We’ll fight ’em to a finish!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you’d say that,” was Tom’s quiet
comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you can count on me,” said Mr. Swift,
“though I’m not much good when it comes to a
fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve got men enough to fight for me
physically,” said Tom. “What I need is moral
backing, and now that I have it I’m going ahead.
I’ve been trying to fight this thing too much in
the dark. From now on I’ll use not only my
own men, but also the regular police force of
Shopton. Ned, get the chief on the wire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a short time a squad of police were on
guard around Tom’s big plant, while, as the day
drew to a close and the hour approached for
the test demonstration, the regular workmen
searched for anything that might give color to
the threat to blow the place up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just when it seemed that nothing would be
found, several of the men, under the leadership
of Mr. Jackson, made a startling discovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found where the big outside fence had
been tunneled under and, working from there,
came upon several mines that were planted near
important buildings in a manner that would
have done credit to a wartime mining party.
From the mines buried wires led outside the
fence to a little gully. There, beneath a clump
of bushes, the ends of the wires lay. All that
remained was to connect them to a detonating
battery. Then the mines could all be set off at
once and the Swift plant surely would be terribly
damaged, if not wholly destroyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re regular fiends!” gasped Ned, when
the extent of the vile plot had been laid bare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they could easily have blown us up but
for that warning,” Tom admitted. “Yet it may
all have been a bluff. They might not have
gone to extremes. But I dared not take a
chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” agreed his chum. “Well, what’s the
next move?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift did not answer immediately.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>USELESS PLEADINGS</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span> was profoundly disturbed by the
momentous discoveries that had taken place
around the Swift Construction Company’s plant.
He did not believe it possible, with all his precautions,
that so deep and dangerous a plot could
have been brought so near to fruition as it had
been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” asked Ned remindingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” and Tom appeared to come out of a
disagreeable reverie. “Well, there are several
things that must be done, Ned. In the first
place we must take newer and better precautions
to keep these rascals out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s plain enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the next thing to do is to go ahead with
this thing and push it to a conclusion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean the talking-picture machine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it. After that we’ll consider what is
next to be done. But you and Mr. Damon had
better be getting ready,” and Tom smiled for
the first time since Eradicate had given him the
threatening note that proved to be such a timely
warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready for what?” Ned wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the performance you are to give for the
benefit of Mary, Helen, and the other visitors.
They’ll be here soon. It’s getting late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean, in the face of what happened,
that you’re going to put on a program of songs
and dances?” asked Ned, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” Tom questioned. “Nothing
really happened. There was no blowing up of
the plant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but it came mighty close to it. We
don’t know what hour those fellows set for attaching
the detonator to the ends of the wires,
and then it would have been a skyrocket trip
for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but it <i>didn’t</i> happen,” insisted Tom,
with another smile. “ ‘A miss is as good as a
mile,’ you know. We’re safe and sound. We
are well guarded now and I want to see if my
machine will do what I hope it will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” assented Ned, with a shake of his
head. “On with the dance, let Mr. Damon and
myself be unconfined. I’m game if you are,
Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my dominoes, so am I!” added the odd
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There really is no danger now,” Tom insisted.
“I’m not saying but what the scoundrels may
try it again. But, for the time being, we are
safe. It’s just as it is after a hard thunder
storm,” he went on. “There’ll be no danger
from the lightning for some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may be right there,” agreed Ned.
“Well, come on, Mr. Damon. We’ll do our part
to make the entertainment a success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after this Mary Nestor and her parents
arrived in answer to the invitation Tom
had sent them, and they were followed soon by
Helen Morton, whom Ned greeted with a warm
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s going on?” Mary wanted to know
of Tom. “We were stopped two or three times
on our way through your grounds and made to
show the passes you sent us. What’s the cause?
Is it war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like that,” admitted Tom.
“We’re having a little trouble with some men
who don’t like what I’m doing. But I think the
worst is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, not telling what danger he and Ned
had been in, Tom Swift gave his friends a brief
description of the new talking-picture machine
and prepared them for what they were going to
see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary, Helen and their parents took their
seats in the laboratory with Mr. Swift and Tom,
while Ned and Mr. Damon went to the broadcasting
studio, there to don their red and violet
robes. Tom had not yet succeeded in making it
possible to render sharp and clear performers
attired in garments of other colors or combination
of colors, though he hoped, by the use of
filter screens, to bring this about later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eradicate and another man were instructed
to keep strict guard on all approaches to the
broadcasting room while the performance was
going on. Koku, armed with a big club, and
another man with a gun were stationed outside
the private laboratory. But Tom did not have
Koku and the other guard stationed until Mary
and the others were in the room, so the visitors
did not see these warlike preparations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The switches were turned, the wires hummed,
the tubes glowed with their strange lights and
the black screen became milky white. Then, as
over the loud speaker, came the words of the
song rendered by Ned and Mr. Damon in the
distant room, there also appeared very plain
images of the two performers. The transmission
was the best Tom had ever succeeded in producing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Tom, it’s wonderful!” exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marvelous!” echoed Helen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finest thing I ever saw!” declared Mr. Nestor.
“If you’re selling stock in this, Tom, put
me down for a good subscription.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same here!” added Mr. Morton. “It’s going
to be epoch-making, Tom Swift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’m afraid of—it’s too epoch-making,”
said Mr. Swift, but he did not explain
what he meant nor did his visitors ask. They
were too much interested in listening to and
looking at Ned Newton and Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned’s earlier description of the odd man’s
performance was fully borne out by what happened.
At one time Ned had to quit from sheer
exhaustion in laughing, but Mr. Damon went on
alone, singing, dancing, improvising, telling
jokes and funny stories until he had his unseen
audience in gales of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tom, how was it?” asked Ned, when
the performance was over and they were all together
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good! But it must be better yet. I
don’t want to limit the performers to red and
violet robes. But I have thought of a simple
method of getting around that. Color filters,
such as are used in printing photography, will
do the trick. I’m not worried about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little laboratory was rather close and
stuffy, so the door leading into the hall was
opened for air. Mary looked out. She
screamed, and turned quickly toward Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Tom instantly.
“Is there—” He thought Greenbaum might be
trying some other trick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is Koku armed with that big club and
the other man with a gun?” asked Mary
suspiciously. “Is there some danger? Oh,
Tom——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The memory of the kidnapping of the two
young men came vividly into her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s danger—terrible danger!” exclaimed
Helen. “I can tell by the boys’ faces,” she
added, looking from Tom and Ned to Mary.
“They are trying to hide it from us; but there’s
danger, and I know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Ned remarked later, “the beans were
spilled then and there,” and though he and Tom
tried to put the girls and their parents off, there
was no denying that something unusual was
afoot. The upshot of it was that the whole
story of the buried mines came out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom, you’ve got to give this thing up!”
urged Mary, taking him by the arm. “It’s a
wonderful invention, undoubtedly, but it isn’t
worth your life, nor Ned’s. You must give it
up! Let those men have it to destroy if they
want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” cried Tom. “I’m going through
with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then followed earnest but useless pleadings
on the part of the young ladies and their parents.
Seeing how firm Tom was, Helen and
Mary turned their attention to Ned, seeking
to get him to prevail upon his chum to cast the
invention aside. But Ned was as firm as his
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m going ahead with it no matter what
comes!” was Tom’s final decision. “But I’m
going to set a trap for these scoundrels and I
think I’ll catch them. The talking-picture machine
must be perfected, in spite of these fellows.
But they’ll find two can play at the same game.
I’m going to set a trap!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhat reassured by Tom’s confident manner,
the girls and their parents felt better, though
they could not shake off the fear that something
would happen. Nor was Tom as easy in his
mind as he seemed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were refreshments after the demonstration,
which had been a success in spite of the excitement
preceding it, and then Tom and Ned
took the girls home, their parents having gone
on ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tom,” remarked Ned when the two
young men were on their way back to the laboratory
to make sure it was carefully locked
and guarded for the night, “I thought, once, that
Mary was going to prevail on you to give it
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in a hundred years! I’m going
through with it. Why, I’ve got to or face ruin
of another sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean financially?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You know how much money I’ve got
tied up in this machine. It’s all we could beg or
borrow or spare from my other ventures. If I
scrapped it now, all that cash would be lost.
As it is, if I go on and put the machine on the
market, I stand a chance to get it back with a
profit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so. The banks have begun
to ask questions. I guess it’s sink or swim
from now on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’re going to <i>swim</i>!” declared Tom
Swift, with a confident smile. “Give me an even
break, and I’ll beat those fellows at their own
game!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you do, Tom. But what sort of trap
are you going to set?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell you in the morning. I want to sleep
over it,” and with that Tom turned into the
house.</p>

<h3>AN ANONYMOUS ADVERTISEMENT</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“Well</span>, they didn’t blow us up,” remarked
Ned Newton to his chum the following morning
after having awakened in the Swift home,
having occupied the room next to his friend
during the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and I suppose we can be thankful for
that,” agreed Tom. “But they might just as
well have had a bomb under my bed for all the
rest I got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you sleep well?” Ned wanted to know,
though a look at his friend’s face was enough
to tell the story. Tom’s eyes had dark half
circles under them and it was plain that he had
not rested enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly any,” was the answer. “This thing
is getting on my nerves, Ned. I’ve got to do
something!” and the voice was a bit irritable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me you’ve done a lot, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’ve invented one of the most wonderful
machines in the world—one that will
make it possible for a man not only to sit at
home in a comfortable chair and listen to the
best music that’s played, but he can, by a turn
of a switch, see theatrical plays. And, not only
have you done that, but you’ve called the turn
on the scoundrels who tried to stop you half
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t quite called the turn, as you call
it, Ned. There is still a lot to do to uncover the
acts of those fellows. One of the first things
I want to do is to find out how they got in and
did their work so secretly. They must have
had help from inside,” added Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His first step was to set Ned at work on financial
matters, to ascertain just how much longer
the Swift Construction Company could operate
without going to the wall. Its credit was excellent,
which was a great deal in its favor.
And Tom hoped soon to have his talking pictures
in shape to offer some of the machines for
sale, or at least to sell stock in a company that
might market them to the retail trade. In this
way he would be assured soon of a large amount
of ready cash. He knew several firms who
would be willing to underwrite an issue of bonds,
once he could demonstrate that his machine was
a success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having attended to these money matters,
which were always more or less of a bore to Tom,
the young inventor turned his attention to matters
of more interest to him. One was to see
that the delicate mechanism of his invention
had not been disturbed during the night, and
the other was to make a more careful examination
with a view to finding out how his plant
had been mined by the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku and Eradicate had both slept in the
private laboratory, and on Tom’s entrance they
reported that nothing unusual had occurred during
the night. It was the fear that, after all,
something untoward might take place that had
prompted Ned to spend the night with his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far so good!” mused Tom, after he had
made sure his invention was in working order.
“Now for a look around the grounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He soon saw what had been apparent at the
casual inspection the night before, namely, that
the plotters had tunneled under the fence in
order to plant their bombs. Doubtless, they had
found out to their sorrow that the wires on top
of the barrier carried a disabling current of electricity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was in that way that the gang had
gained entrance to the grounds. They had
worked in secret, by night it was likely, and had
thus been able to plant several dangerous bombs
and run wires attached to them outside the fence
and into the little gully mentioned before. All
that was needed was the exploding spark and
the Swift plant would have been a mass of ruins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bombs had been carefully taken up and
soaked in water. They were then—and this
work was only now finished—dissected in an
effort to learn some clue as to the constructors.
But the work had been cunningly done. Tom
suspected that the gang had hired some band
of anarchists to make the bombs for them, probably
keeping the makers in ignorance of what
the deadly machines were to be used for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once the bombs were removed, the connecting
wires pulled up and all traces of the work
removed, Tom had some of his men arrange
matters so that a recurrence of the danger was
impossible. At intervals along the fence metal
rods were driven into the earth and so arranged,
by means of electric wires, that any disturbance
of the earth near them would be registered on
dials in the central watch tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will keep them out, or at least give
warning of their attempts,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, as the fence was still guarded on top
by the powerful current and now was protected
from beneath, there was little likelihood that
any plotters could get in. Double guards were
posted night and day at all entrance gates and
not until then did Tom Swift feel secure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then set to work with redoubled energy to
put the finishing touches to his newest patent
and felt sure he had solved the one remaining
problem—that of making visible all colors on
his screen. This he accomplished by filters of
glass, something after the manner in which colored
moving pictures are taken, but using a
process of his own that he had only recently
discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Tom was kept busy putting the finishing
touches to his machine, he was not freed
from trouble. Every now and then he would
get a report from some of his many shops that
the place had been entered and things turned
upside down, evidently in a search for some of
the young inventor’s secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t they lay off and let me alone?”
exclaimed Tom angrily one morning after some
particularly annoying damage had been done in
his airship shop the night before. “What’s their
game, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To make you give up, I guess,” answered
Ned. “They can’t get at your talking-picture
machine, you’ve got that too well guarded. But
to guard the rest of the plant you’d have to keep
a full force here day and night, and that’s out
of the question with our bank balance as low
as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I realize that, Ned. Yet I’ve got to do something
desperate. It may take some money, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we aren’t down to our last dollar, when
it comes to that,” Ned replied. “But it would
be ruinous to be paying a night force as well as
a day force, particularly when the former would
only be used as guards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to do that,” declared Tom.
“It’s time, I think, to put into operation my
other scheme—the one I had in mind the night
we discovered the bombs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What plan is that, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an anonymous advertisement in the papers,
making certain offers and proposing certain
terms to my enemies. Here, I’ll show you what
I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom thought for a few moments with pencil
poised over a pad. Then he wrote rapidly and
handed the sheet of paper to Ned. This is what
his chum read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>RAPID young man, who is being held back in
his work by threats and annoying, sneaking
night attacks, will pay any reasonable sum just
to be let alone so that he may proceed with his
inventions. He wants to be swift in completing
his work and it can easily be pictured how this
talk about making trouble annoys him. A
large sum will be paid for freedom from future
annoyance. Answer in confidence, QUICK,
Box 123 Evening Graphic Office.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you intend to insert this advertisement
in the <i>Graphic</i>?” asked Ned, naming the Shopton
evening paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I do. Don’t you think they
will understand it even without my name being
to it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think the scoundrels might,”
chuckled Ned. “You have as good as told them
by the use of the words rapid, swift and quick,
to say nothing of mentioning your talking-picture
machine. Do you think that is wise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they know I’m working on it,” said Tom.
“It’s no use to pretend they don’t. The secret
is out, but I don’t care. I’ve got the patent
rights sewed up now. But I must be let alone
in order to finish the last details. Take that ad
in, Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. I hope it brings results.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it will,” said Tom, with a significant
smile. “It’s bait for a trap, and there will be
some surprises when it springs shut!”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE MEETING</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Disappointment</span> would have been in store for
Tom Swift and his close associates if they had
expected any immediate results from the insertion
of the anonymous advertisement. Ned
Newton went to the designated box in the newspaper
office several times following the printing
of the cunningly worded request for an interview
with the unknown scoundrels, but there
were no letters addressed to Mr. Quick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it isn’t going to work, Tom,” remarked
Ned, after the fourth day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give ’em time,” was the calm reply of the
young inventor. “Rome wasn’t built in a day
and you can’t catch these rascals in the first trap
you set.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you still intend to catch them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sure do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you disappointed that they haven’t
taken the bait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet. In fact, I’m better pleased than
if they had put in a reply at once. It shows
that there are big and important men back of
this movement. If they had been petty grafters
or fellows who were just working to get a certain
sum out of me—a comparatively small sum—they
would have answered right off. As it is,
the delay shows they are taking their time
and considering the thing from all angles. But
I think they’ll bite sooner or later and grant me
the interview I desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that what you want—just an interview?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s part of it,” was Tom’s answer,
given with a peculiar smile. “Once I’m face to
face with this gang I’ll know what to do. I’ve
pretty well settled it in my own mind that there
are big interests fighting me, and, like large
bodies, they move slowly. It will be all the
better for the success of my plans if they don’t
bite too quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’re not quite ready for them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite, but I shall be in a day or so.
Meanwhile, let the ad run. They’ve seen it and
are a bit puzzled over what course to take, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll leave it to you,” Ned remarked.
“I’ve got my own troubles, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean about finances?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We’re sailing pretty close to the wind.
You’ve sunk much money in these talking
pictures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I realized that when you showed me the figures.
But, as I said, it’s sink or swim now, and
I think we’ll swim after I get through with these
fellows who are hounding me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was three days after this that Ned, coming
away from a bank the president of which had
suggested that some of the Swift loan had better
be reduced soon, stopped in at the <i>Graphic</i>
office. He presented the slip calling for any
replies that might have been received for Mr.
Quick of Box 123, and, somewhat to his surprise,
he was handed an envelope. The paper
was of good quality, though perfectly plain, and
the address was neatly printed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re taking no chances of handwriting
being traced,” remarked Ned, as he hurried back
to the laboratory with the missive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This may mean business, Tom,” he said to
his chum, “or it may be a suggestion from some
other paper that you would do well to put the ad
in their columns. That’s a newspaper trick,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it is,” assented the young inventor.
“However, this may mean business.” He tore
the envelope open and he had no sooner scanned
the few lines on a single sheet of paper within
than he cried: “Hurray!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it from your enemies?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is. Read it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned let his eyes rove over this:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“If Mr. Quick will present himself at a certain
house on Rattlesnake Island he will learn something
to his advantage. Mr. Quick must present
himself absolutely alone. If there is any
attempt at trickery all negotiations will be
called off and vigorous retaliatory measures at
once undertaken. Come this midnight.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going, Tom?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alone—and to Rattlesnake Island where we
were held prisoners?” cried Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? They won’t try any trick like
that again. They’ll know I wouldn’t walk into
a trap like that without leaving word where I
am bound for and my non-appearance in due
time would mean a search. They aren’t such
fools as that. I’ll go and see what they have to
say. I’ll be there when the clock strikes
twelve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They aren’t giving you much time for preparation.
It’s after two o’clock now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all the time I need. I’ve been anticipating
this and I’m ready. Now, Ned, I’ll let
you into some of my secrets that I’ve been holding
out on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon Tom told Ned something which
made that young man open his eyes. But even
at the end, when the plans were all detailed, the
business manager was a bit doubtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s risky, Tom,” he said. “I’m afraid to
have you go there alone to meet these fellows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no danger, I tell you. I’m not
afraid. My plans have been too carefully made
to permit of failure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ned’s face was serious, and when Mr.
Swift heard of what his son proposed to do he
added his appeals to the young inventor, asking
him to try some other and less risky method.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the only way,” declared Tom. “I’m
going to that midnight meeting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the time came, Tom Swift set off in one
of his motorboats alone, heading across Lake
Carlopa in the darkness, guiding his craft toward
the sinister black shape of Rattlesnake Island.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>MASKED MEN</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span> sat at the wheel of his craft, his
hands on the spokes and his eyes gazing ahead
through the darkness. He had set a straight
course for Rattlesnake Island and wondered
what would happen after he arrived. In spite
of his bold words to Ned Newton, the young inventor
was a little apprehensive, as well he
might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He scanned the water on either side of him
for a possible sight of other craft that might be
heading in the same direction. But though in
the distance he saw and heard other motorboats,
none seemed to be laying a course for Rattlesnake
Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if they’ll be there—and on time,”
mused Tom. He did not whisper, even to the
unoccupied darkness about him, any designation
of those he had in mind. He merely said: “I
wonder if they’ll be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not a long run, in Tom’s speedy craft,
to the sinister, dark island where he and Ned
had lately been prisoners, and almost before he
had finished going over in his mind the various
occurrences that had taken place since he had
begun working on his talking-picture machine,
the young inventor found himself approaching
the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder if I’m to land at the dock where
Snogg and Janner tied up the <i>Turtle</i>. Or am I
to circle the island until I get a sign?” mused
Tom. “From the fact that they have named as
a rendezvous the old house, I should think it
would be at the same dock where Ned and I
saw those rascals working on their boat the time
we gave them the slip. Think I’ll try there first,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was a good navigator, and it did not take
him long to get his bearings and head for the
dock in question. As he approached it, he saw
a dim light on it and this convinced him that
he was to tie up there. Slowing his boat to half
speed, for he was not sure about the state of
water, and thinking there might be rocks, the
young man stood up and strained his eyes to
pierce the gloom. The single lantern on the end
of the dock gave illumination enough to make
certain that the way was clear, as far as obstructions
in the water were concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here I go—for better or for worse,” said
Tom grimly to himself as he shut off power and
allowed his craft to glide up to the stringpiece.
The dock was rather a ruin, but he found a ring
in a beam and made his rope fast there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, before getting out of the boat, Tom
looked sharply about as well as he could by such
illumination as a smoking lantern gave. There
was no sight nor sound of any other visitor to
Rattlesnake Island. Tom seemed to be the only
one there. Yet he knew there were others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I’m to go right up and knock at
the front door,” and Tom chuckled a little.
“They don’t seem to have appointed a reception
committee with a brass band. Guess those fellows
don’t do business that way. Well, might
as well get started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before getting out of his boat, however, he
made sure that the mooring rope was tied in
such a way that, if need be, he could make a
running jump into the craft, pull the knot out
with one tug of the free end and so be loosed
from the dock. Also he made certain that his
motor would start at once. It was a powerful
and speedy craft in which Tom had come to
the island—one that would start with a throw
of a switch, not needing any laborious cranking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might want to get away in a hurry,” he had
reasoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus having taken all precautions to serve
him in case of emergency, Tom clambered up on
the dock and started for the shore end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he left the circle of friendly rays from the
lantern, he could not prevent a slight feeling of
uneasiness creeping over him. After all, it was
a risky thing that he was doing—trusting himself
alone to unknown men who had every motive
for wishing him out of the way or, if not
exactly out of the way, at least prevented from
pursuing his activities in certain directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I think I’m going to beat them at their
own game,” mused Tom, as he walked along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His feet made ghostly echoes on the rattling
planks of the old dock, and, now and then, he
paused to ascertain if any one else in the neighborhood
were stirring. However, he appeared
to be the only one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s see,” mused the young inventor as he
was about to step off the dock to the shore.
“As I remember it, the dock was to the east of
the house when Ned and I looked out of the
window and saw the three men. So I must turn
right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly he swung in that direction as
he started up a path that was partly overgrown
with weeds. It was quite dark, once he had
left the glow of the dock lantern, and Tom was
glad he had brought a pocket flashlight with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Switching this on, he let the bright rays fall
in front of him to guide his steps so he would
not get off the path. For he had in mind the
sinister name of the island to which he was paying
a midnight visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say the rattlesnakes are all gone,”
mused Tom, as he kept as nearly as he could to
the middle of the path, “but I’m taking no
chances of stepping on one. I don’t want to
tread on a tail and be bitten. Even if their bite
isn’t always deadly, it’s bad enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of himself, Tom could not prevent a
creepy feeling coming over him at times as he
walked along on the path. He almost wished
he had not selected this means of tricking the
plotters. But it was too late to turn back now.
He had made his choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, when he judged that he was half
way to the old house, Tom heard a noise in the
bushes just ahead of him and off to the left.
For a moment he had a fear that it might be the
rustle caused by the passage of a rattlesnake
through the underbrush. He flashed his light in
that direction, but instead of the beams picking
up the gliding form of a serpent they illuminated
the feet and legs of a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Tom could cry out or step back, he
heard another noise on his right, and there, too,
his flashlight revealed the feet and legs of another
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the four feet and four legs made a
rush and Tom felt himself caught by the arm on
either side. His flashlight was knocked from his
hand, but, falling to the ground, still glowed and
its rays showed Tom that he had been caught by
two Negroes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go!” he cried, fiercely struggling
to free himself. But the black men held him
fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then one spoke, in rather soothing accents,
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, sir. We don’t aim to be rough
with you, but we got our orders. I’m sorry I
knocked your light down. I’ll pick it up for
you,” and, stooping, he retrieved the flashlight
which he gave to Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better put it in your pocket, sir,” suggested
the other Negro. “You won’t need it where
you’re going. We know the path in the dark.
And don’t be worried. We aren’t going to hurt
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not worried,” declared Tom boldly.
“But this is an outrage! I came here of my own
free will for a conference and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, sir,” went on the first black
man, still soothingly. “You’re going to be
taken to the conference. That’s what we came
down for—to meet you and show you the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was at once struck by the fact that the
language of these Negroes was above the average.
They did not talk like poor, old Eradicate.
Rather their talk was that of the man who has
seen service in wealthy families. As this was
in line with Tom’s theories regarding the identity
of the men persecuting him, he ceased to
struggle and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. Lead me to the men with whom
I have an appointment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what we’ll do, sir,” said the man
who had picked up the flashlight. “It’s just a
bit farther on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Negroes seemed able to find their way in
the dark, which, Tom reflected, was more than
he could have done. In a short time they led
him, gently enough, into a little clearing and
there, showing dimly in the light of the stars,
was the house where Tom and Ned had been
prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Tom had any compunctions about entering
the house again he had no time to exercise
them. Nor, be it known, had he the inclination.
He was there for a purpose and intended
to carry it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right this way, sir,” said one of the Negroes,
letting go of Tom’s right arm and preceding him
to the front door. “They’re expecting you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knocked—whether in a signal code or not
Tom was unable to determine—and the door
was opened, letting out a flood of light. The
place seemed to have been prepared for the reception
of the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go straight ahead,” said the Negro who had
opened the door, as he stepped back to allow
Tom to enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom walked into a hall, furnished only with
a chair. One of the three Negroes—which he
could not determine—glided ahead of him,
tapped on a door at the end of the corridor, and
opened it in response to a voice that said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift saw before him a brilliantly
lighted room. Gathered around a table in the
middle were half a dozen men. Each one wore
a black mask and through the eye-holes in them
Tom felt himself being sharply scrutinized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may go, Richard,” said one of the men
in cultured tones to the Negro who had opened
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the masked faces silently regarded the
young inventor.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>A TEMPTING OFFER</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“Sit</span> down, please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The masked man at the head of the table—who
seemed to be the leader—thus spoke to
Tom and motioned to a chair, the only one in
the room that was not occupied. Tom looked
at it a bit suspiciously at first. He knew something
of trick chairs—seats that, once occupied,
gripped the sitter in arms of steel. Also this
chair might be over some trapdoor which opened
into a pit or into a tunnel that led to the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom reflected that if the men had contemplated
treachery they could have exercised
their will upon him when he first landed on the
island. They need not have waited until now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chair seemed an ordinary one, and as the
leader motioned toward it another of the masked
men pulled it slightly forward. Clearly it had
no mechanism connected with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m here,” said Tom, as he settled back
in the chair, noting that it felt all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we see, and we are glad of this chance to
do business with you,” remarked one, who, for
want of a better designation at present, shall be
denominated Mr. X. “It did not occur to us,”
he went on in cultured tones, “that you would
care for this method of arriving at a settlement.
But, since you have, it appears to be a very good
one. We are ready to do business with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was at once impressed by something
that was very evident. These were substantial
business men—men of some culture and presumably
position in the world—though they did
stoop to desperate means to gain their ends.
They were of an entirely different class from
Snogg and Janner who had kidnapped Tom
and Ned. Nor were they like Greenbaum,
though from two or three little signs Tom had
an idea that some of these men were very
wealthy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am here,” went on Tom, holding himself
well in hand and gazing from one masked
face to the other. “And I am glad to hear that
you are ready to talk business. But there is one
objection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Mr. Swift?” asked Mr. X courteously.
“If you object to the method of meeting
us, remember it was your own suggestion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not complaining of the place of meeting
nor the manner in which I was received,”
stated Tom. “But I’m not used to doing business
in the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the dark?” wonderingly exclaimed a
heavy-set man on the left of Mr. X. “Why, it’s
light here. Should we spend a lot more money
in having more electricity? No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was not referring to the actual lighting of
the place,” returned Tom, with a little smile.
“It’s bright enough in one way. But when I
said I was not in the habit of doing business in
the dark, I referred to your masks. I like to
see to whom I am talking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so he means that!” exclaimed the heavy
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry, Mr. Swift,” put in Mr. X, who
seemed affable enough. “But you will realize
that at present we must, for obvious reasons,
remain unknown to you. Perhaps you would
not recognize us if we laid aside our masks, but
that we cannot do. There are too many interests,
aside from our own, involved in this to allow
it. So if you feel that you cannot talk
freely under the present circumstances you are
at liberty to depart as you came and matters will
be the same as before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean,” asked Tom sharply, “that I
shall be subjected to the same spying observations
and attempts made to destroy my plant
and my talking-picture machine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not said so,” was the calm answer.
“You are at liberty to put any construction you
like on my decision.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There can be but one decision!” snapped
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. X nodded his head in assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must take us or leave us just as you
find us—masked,” he said slowly. “But I, repeat
my offer that you may withdraw at any
time and you will not be harmed in the least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No!” exclaimed the heavy man, with
a gesture of dissent. “We want to settle this
business now. It is a big business—it must be
settled! I cannot sleep nights thinking what I
may lose. It is terrible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will please let me conduct these negotiations,”
said Mr. X coldly, turning to the interrupter.
“Mr. Swift must decide for himself.
He asked for this interview and he must accept
our conditions of granting it. Our masks remain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” replied Tom, with a shrug of his
shoulders. “It is a small matter, perhaps. We
will talk business, as you suggest. You read my
advertisement?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless, or we should not be here, nor you,
either,” replied Mr. X, lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you said you would pay a good sum to
be let alone!” broke in the stout man, who might
be called Mr. B, for he resembled that letter in
build.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I said that,” answered Tom. “And I
am willing to keep my word. But I may as well
say, here and now, that I am not prepared to
pay cash. I have used so much money in perfecting
my machine for showing in private
homes talking pictures of theatrical plays and
the broadcasting of opera and vaudeville
that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is it perfect? Will it work?” anxiously
gasped Mr. B.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It works!” answered Tom. “All I need do
now is to put it on the market and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is just what we do not intend to let you
do!” broke in Mr. X. “You will not be allowed
to do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not allowed?” came from Tom quietly.
“Those are big words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we are big men in more senses than
one,” said Mr. X, still softly. “There is no use
beating about the bush. We know who you
are, it is only fair you should know who we are,
Mr. Swift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you will unmask, after all?” inquired
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but we will tell you what interests we
represent—if you have not already guessed
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I can guess,” stated Tom. “You are
a big syndicate of moving picture operators.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The guess does credit to your intelligence,
Tom Swift,” said Mr. X. “We represent many
large moving picture and theatrical interests of
the United States, and we are frank to say that
we see ruin ahead of us if your invention goes
on the market uncontrolled, at least in part, by
our interests. I admit that your invention may
revolutionize our industry. If a man can sit
in his own home and listen to a radio program,
and, at the same time, see the performers, he
certainly won’t put on a starched shirt and a
stiff collar and pay from two to seven dollars for
a seat in the theater.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he won’t even come to a fifty cent
movie!” lamented Mr. B.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True enough,” agreed Mr. X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to know something of my affairs,”
said Tom, with a rueful smile. “You have not
missed much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know more than you think we do,”
boasted Mr. X. “At the same time we realize
that you are far from beaten, so we wish to suggest
a compromise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are going to make you a handsome offer!”
broke in Mr. B, much to the evident annoyance
of his colleague. “You will be tempted
by it, I am sure. In short——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I was to do the talking,” interrupted
Mr. X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. Let him do it,” put in two
others of the masked men. Each looked like a
hard-headed American business man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll listen to any offer you wish to make,”
Tom stated. “I came here prepared to make an
offer myself. But I will first listen to yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not help admitting that the men
knew more than he had suspected. In spite of
the fact that he had tried to keep his invention a
secret, the general principle of it had become
known to these theatrical and moving picture
men. Doubtless they had paid their spies and
plotters well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To get down to business,” resumed Mr. X,
“we are prepared to offer you a million dollars,
Tom Swift. A million dollars!” he repeated
unctuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think of that, my friend!” broke in Mr. B,
who could not keep still. “A whole million!”
His voice capitalized the word. “All your own
to do as you like with! A million dollars!
Think of it!”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>FLASHING LIGHTS</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Grave</span> though the situation was, Tom Swift
could not help smiling a little at the evident sincerity
and anxiety of Mr. B. Nor were the
others less vitally interested. They leaned forward
over the table, staring at Tom’s face, which
was in the full glare of a powerful light. They
wanted to see if Tom would give under the
strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the young inventor held himself well in
hand. Though he was not quite prepared for
the offer, it did not catch him napping. He
still had some cards to play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” asked Mr. X, slowly, when there had
been a few seconds of silence following his offer,
“what do you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to ask a few questions,” Tom replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s only fair,” conceded Mr. X. “We’ll
not promise to answer anything you want to
know, however,” he stipulated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’ll answer this one,” said Tom,
with a smile. “There are always two sides to
an offer,” he went on. “One is money, or some
other payment. You have that on your side.
Now what am I to give in exchange for this million
dollars? That’s a fair question, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much so,” agreed Mr. X. “And a natural
one. In exchange for the million we will
agree to give you, you, on your part, will hand
over to us all patent and other papers, including
sketches, designs, patterns and blue prints of
your so-called talking-picture machine. In
short, you will turn the complete invention over
to us, and further make a promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of a promise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A promise to go no farther in that field. In
other words, you will forget that such a machine
is capable of being made. You will wipe it out
of your mind after you have turned all your
rights in it over to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And may I inquire what you will do with my
machine when you get it?” asked Tom, with a
curious smile as he shifted about in his chair, as
though it was no longer comfortable. “If you
do get it in exchange for a million dollars,” he
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll burn it up—destroy it!” excitedly cried
Mr. B.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift could not help starting in surprise.
The answer was not quite what he had expected.
He looked for confirmation toward the masked
Mr. X, thinking the big man might have spoken
impulsively. But, somewhat to the astonishment
of the young inventor, the leader nodded
in assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once you turn your invention over to us in
exchange for the million dollars,” stated Mr. X,
“it becomes our exclusive property for us to do
with as we please. And, very likely, we shall
destroy it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?” Tom could not help impulsively
asking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To prevent our business from being ruined,
young man! That’s why!” burst out Mr. B.
“Do you think,” he went on in spite of the effort
Mr. X made to silence him, “we want people to
stay at home listening to music and seeing pictures
of a performance on your screen? Where
would we be if millions of people did about pictures
what they are doing right now with their
radio receivers? We’d be ruined in six months
and we have millions tied up in our theaters—millions!
No, sir. Once we get your machine
we’ll destroy it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t got it yet,” Tom saw fit to remind
him quietly. “And now, since you have
been frank with me I will be the same with you.
Your offer of a million dollars seems big to you.
But let me tell you this. If you offered me ten
millions with the proviso that my machine be
destroyed I’d snap my fingers at you as I do
now!” and Tom suited the action to his words,
rising from the chair as he did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen, I shall bid you good evening!”
he went on. “I have found out what I wanted
to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Mr. B’s fingers went to the mask on
his face. Evidently he feared it had slipped and
revealed his identity. Tom could not help smiling
as he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know who you are personally,
and I don’t know that I care. It may make no
difference. But I can discover your identities
if I choose. That is neither here nor there.
The point is I refuse your offer and I’m going
back to my laboratory and perfect my machine.
Inside of a month it will be on the market!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! oh!” wailed Mr. B. Some of the others
showed evidence of perturbation, but Mr. X remained
calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down again, Mr. Swift,” he said, and his
tone was not as smooth as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a command or an invitation?” asked
Tom sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may regard it either way you like,” was
the reply. And Tom did not need to be told
that the playing was over—stern reality was
now to the fore. The men still had masks on
their faces, but they no longer masked their intentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute,” said Tom, still standing by
the chair. “You said, at the beginning that I
was here of my own free will—that I could walk
out of here any time I wished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was true at the time it was stated,” said
Mr. X. “I may withdraw my offer any time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you withdrawn it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s pause and then came
the low reply:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have. Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I am not free to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not until you listen further to me,” said Mr.
X. “I think you are very unwise, Tom Swift.
We have made you a liberal offer. It is much
more than you can make for a long time if you
market your apparatus. We are interested in
controlling it. What difference does it make
to you whether we buy the machine and manufacture
it in such quantities as we please or if
we buy it and destroy it—as long as you get
your price?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just it!” replied Tom angrily. “I’m
not getting my price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might increase our offer,” suggested
Mr. X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A certain man once said,” remarked Tom
slowly, “that he was poor, but, poor as he was,
the King of England was not rich enough to buy
him. I say the same to you now. I am in need
of funds—I do not hesitate to admit that. But,
slender as my bank balance is, there is not
enough cash among you masked men to pay me
for destroying a machine I have worked so hard
over—a machine which I hope will prove to be a
delight to humanity. That’s my answer. In
other words, I defy you! I’m through! I’m
going to walk out of here now. This conference
is ended!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, it isn’t ended yet,” said Mr. X in
sinister tones as he arose and stepped toward a
push button on the wall. “We have something
else to say to you, Tom Swift. I didn’t want
to resort to harsh means, but there seems to be
no hope for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute!” exclaimed the young inventor.
“I think I understand your game.
Perhaps you think you can torture me into giving
in. Or you may even have it in mind to kill
me, thinking, thereby, to prevent my machine
from being perfected and going on the market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to what I say. If you do away with
me it will make no difference to that machine.
It is complete and will be made and marketed.
Full details of the invention are already in
Washington to be patented. More than this—four
models have been made. One is in my laboratory
where you may get at it and destroy it—I
don’t say you can’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there are three other complete and working
models in the hands of three friends of mine
in different parts of the country. They have
orders in case I do not reappear by a certain
time to make public all the facts and to put the
machine on the market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! oh! He’s got us beat!” lamented the
big man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he hasn’t!” snarled Mr. X. “I’ll force
him to do as we want him to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so you talk of force now, do you?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you compel me—yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it is time for me to play the same
game,” went on the young inventor, with a tantalizing
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” came from three of the
men, in evident alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My instructions were,” said Tom, “to come
to this island alone. I did so, as you doubtless
know. But early this morning a number of my
friends preceded me here—and they are here
now. Gentlemen, this house is entirely surrounded.
None of you can possibly escape—neither
you nor your Negro thugs. If I am not
permitted to walk out of here unmolested whenever
I please, I will give the signal and you
will at once be arrested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think we will believe such a foolish
statement as that?” scoffed Mr. X. “I tell you
that you are at our mercy, Tom Swift! This
house surrounded? Bosh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer Tom went to a window and raised
the shade. At the same time he pressed the wall
switch and plunged the room in darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” cried Tom, and from the darkness
outside, shining through the now dulled window
glass, came a flashing light, thrice repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a gasp of surprise from the masked
men in the dark room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” went on Tom, moving to a window
on the other side of the room. From the
gloom without there shone another of the thrice
flashing lights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the same on the other two sides of the
house,” remarked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The masked men sat silent, seemingly dazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your answer now?” triumphantly
asked the young inventor as it was made plain
to the plotters that they were surrounded.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>TOM ACCEPTS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>,” and Tom Swift put a peculiar
emphasis on the word, “I repeat—what is your
answer now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the rascal! He’s got us beat!” lamented
the fat man. “Let’s make terms with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make terms, nothing!” sneered Mr. X.
“Those are nothing but lightning bugs! It’s all
a clever bluff!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is it?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he stood in front of a window and, as
he had done before, though unseen by the plotters,
Tom raised and flashed the pocket electric
torch he had brought with him. Once more,
in answer to his signal, came more flashes from
without. Tom’s friends were on the alert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess that settles it,” Mr. X was forced
to admit. “Turn on the light here, Tom Swift,
and we’ll talk this matter over again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” exclaimed the young inventor in ringing
tones. “I’ll do the talking now—you’ll do
the listening. I’m in a position to dictate my
terms, and I’ll do it. I owe you something for
the manner in which you had me and my manager
kidnapped and brought to this place, also
for what your tool Greenbaum did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now listen here!” broke in Mr. B, his whole,
fat body quivering with fear as Tom switched
on the main light again. “That Greenbaum
fellow, he went farther than we told him to.
We never told him to try to blow you up, and we
immediately discharged him when we learned of
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is correct,” assented Mr. X. “We do
not countenance deeds of violence. Greenbaum,
whom we have since discharged, went beyond
his instructions—far beyond. But he was half
crazy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half crazy?” inquired Tom. “He always
impressed me as being very level-headed—too
much so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still he was not right in his head,” said Mr.
B. “He lost a small fortune in a moving picture
investment, and when he learned your invention
might spell the ruin of that industry,
so he could never recoup his losses, he went to
desperate lengths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say he did,” agreed Tom, with a
grim smile, as he remembered his ruined laboratory
and the pains he had suffered. “But I
will exact payment for what he did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would be within your rights there,” said
Mr. X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for the indignities Mr. Newton and I
suffered at the hands of Snogg, Janner and
Torpy,” went on the young inventor. “I suppose
you will not deny that they acted for you?”
he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they were our agents,” admitted Mr. B.
“But we told them to treat you with respect,
merely to hold you until we could get in touch
with you. It was a mistake that Mr. Newton
was kidnapped. We wanted you held. What
terms do you offer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I offer no terms at all. I demand unconditional
surrender!” exclaimed Tom. “If you
don’t agree to that, I propose, to use a war term,
to move immediately upon you. In other
words, I’ll give the signal for your arrest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t! Don’t!” begged Mr. B shakingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are here to make terms, Mr. Swift,” said
a third masked man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want us to do?” asked Mr. X,
and there was no more threat or defiance in his
voice. “You can name your own terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the first place,” stipulated Tom, “I want
you all to unmask. I don’t care to do business
with men I can’t see. You might as well,” he
added, as he saw them hesitate. “If you’re arrested
you will be known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen, he is right!” said Mr. B. “Unmask!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set the example by doffing the black silk
that covered the upper part of his face. One
after another the five followed and Tom gasped
in surprise when he saw who the men were.
They were all important figures in the theatrical
and moving picture business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s the combination I’ve been up
against!” exclaimed the young inventor, as he
looked from one face to another. “I suppose I
should consider it quite an honor to have you
against me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a way, yes,” admitted the one still to be
designated as Mr. X. “You are a mighty lucky
and clever young man. Now we have met your
first stipulation, what is the next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next,” stated Tom, “is that you must
sign a paper which I shall draw up, admitting
your share in all that has been done against me
and agreeing that all persecutions shall cease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that is no more than fair under the circumstances,”
agreed Mr. X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you won’t make that paper public—with
our names on it, will you?” asked Mr. B.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if you let me entirely alone,” promised
Tom. “But I want it to protect myself.
Hands off and that paper remains in my safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Draw it up and we’ll sign it,” agreed Mr. X,
after a hasty conference in one corner with his
colleagues. “But what about the men you have
posted out in the woods? Will they come in
here and arrest us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless I give the signal,” Tom answered.
“It will not be given when you have signed that
paper and I am allowed to walk out of here unmolested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let him go! Let him go!” begged Mr. B.
“He’ll have our watches and pocketbooks next!
Let him go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom smiled grimly as he drew up the paper.
He had the plotters entirely at his mercy. One
after another they affixed their names to the
document, and as he folded it and put it in his
pocket, Mr. B said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps we can still talk business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we made you an offer of a million dollars
for the complete rights to your talking-picture
invention that we might destroy it to
save our business from ruin. You saw fit to
decline that and you got the better of us in what
followed. Now, since it seems that the invention
is going on the market, the next best thing
for us to do is to buy into the exploiting company
and have a share in the profits. I suppose
there will be profits?” he asked, with a somewhat
quizzical smile. He was a big business man,
as Tom knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope there will be,” Tom answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now that we’ve backed down—because
you made us and for no other reason,”
went on Mr. B, “will you listen to another
offer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll give you a million for a half share in
the invention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing doing!” exclaimed Tom, getting
ready to leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A million and a half!” offered Mr. B.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your figure is too low,” replied Tom, who
began to see daylight ahead for Ned Newton’s
financial embarrassment. “Why, you movie
men put a million dollars in a single feature picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, quit being pikers!” put in another magnate.
“Say two millions and be done with it!
Come, what about two, young man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom made some rapid calculations. Two
million dollars was a tempting offer for half an
interest in the invention. He knew it would be
on the market a long time before he would take
in that much. Also he must have capital to
manufacture the machines. But he still had a
card to play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t accept that offer,” he said, still moving
toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let’s get this over with!” exclaimed Mr.
X who, evidently, was used to having his own
way. “We’ll give you three millions for a half
interest, Tom Swift, let you remain in virtual
control, and we’ll start manufacturing as soon as
you demonstrate that it’s a success. What do
you say to that—three millions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s our limit,” put in another of the
men, a tall, lean New Englander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Tom Swift did not reply. To
a casual observer it might have looked as though
he was about to refuse that offer. He had made
up his mind, but he did not want to seem too
hasty. It was well that these men should know
he was their master when it came to plotting and
dickering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how about it?” asked Mr. B anxiously.
“Come, Mr. Tom Swift. Three millions aren’t
to be sneezed at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I don’t intend to sneeze!” said Tom suddenly,
with a little chuckle. “Gentlemen, I accept
your offer. Put it in writing and we’ll call
the conference over!”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>A FINAL TEST</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> was a relieved air about the men gathered
in the old house on Rattlesnake Island now
that Tom Swift had made terms with them.
Truth to tell, they had been more than a little
afraid of this clear-eyed, keen young man who
was able to dictate terms to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now let there be no mistake about this,” said
Tom. “We can draw up a new agreement, incorporating
in it the terms of this one,” and he
produced the rough draft in which the men had
agreed to molest him no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want put in?” asked Mr. X,
producing paper and a fountain pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want this three-million-dollar offer for a
half interest in my invention put into an ironclad
agreement. I also want your written
promise to interfere with me no longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We aren’t likely to bother you, considering
that we are now associated with you in this
thing,” observed Mr. B.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it will do no harm to put it in,” decided
Tom. “Also, I want you to acknowledge
full responsibility for the actions of your men,
Greenbaum and the others, and your promise
to send them far away from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s no more than fair,” agreed Mr. X.
“Those men went further than we told them to
do. We had no sympathy with Greenbaum’s
attempt to blow you up and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was more than an attempt,” interrupted
Tom, with a grim smile. “There really was a
disastrous explosion and I expect to be paid
damages for that out of your share of the profits.
I want that in the agreement, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have it,” promised Mr. X, though
some of his colleagues made rather wry faces at
Tom’s exaction of his “pound of flesh.” But he
was within his rights, and he knew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a short time the agreement was drawn up
and signed by all of them, and then Mr. X remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course this is contingent upon your invention
being a success, Mr. Swift. Your broadcasting
of songs and music must be clear, the
images of the performers on the attached screen
must be very plain, not shadowy forms, and the
two must synchronize. You must remember
that we have not seen your invention. All we
know is what we have heard of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From your spies, doubtless,” Tom responded
bitterly. “And they could find out very little.
But don’t worry. The machine must be perfect
before I put it on the market. I am going to
have a final test and you may witness it in person
or you may send any one you like to report.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of us will probably be on hand when
you give a final showing,” said Mr. X. “And
now, as it is getting late, I suggest that we adjourn.
We want to get back to our homes and
you do also, I suppose, Mr. Swift?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I don’t feel like spending another night
on Rattlesnake Island,” replied Tom, with a
smile. “One was enough. I’ll call in my
friends and you can come to my final test—say
a week from to-night in my private laboratory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Mr. X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom bade the men good-night and went out
into the darkness, leaving the conspirators to
growl somewhat among themselves at having
been beaten by a mere youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the same time,” said Mr. X, “I can’t help
admiring Tom Swift for the manner in which he
turned the tables on us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” chimed in another. “He’s the
pluckiest fellow I ever had any dealings with.
And to think, if we’d persisted, he could have
had us all arrested and our names and our pictures
would have been in the papers. Whew!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh my!” wailed Mr. B. “It’s cost us a
pretty penny, but maybe it will be worth it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Tom, outside the old house, was
signaling with his flashlight to call his friends in
from their posts about the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is everything all right?” asked Ned, who led
one of the four parties. He glided to his chum’s
side from the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything is settled, and we get three million
dollars for a half interest,” said Tom, producing
the agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hot dog!” gleefully cried Ned. “That’s the
best news yet! We sure will need that money,
Tom! I couldn’t have held the banks off much
longer. Good for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a short time Tom and Ned, with Mr.
Damon, Koku and Eradicate were on their way
back across Lake Carlopa, leaving the other
members of the Swift party to follow in other
boats as they pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Tom Swift had gone to Rattlesnake
Island alone as he had been bidden, the setting
of his trap called for many of his most trusted
men to precede him to the rendezvous. They
had gone at intervals so no suspicions would be
aroused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, during the day before the night of the
meeting, several parties of seemingly innocent
fishermen might have been seen landing on the
island at a point farthest removed from the
dock used by Tom. These parties were posted
in the woods on four sides of the frame house
and there they waited for Tom’s signal. Ned
was in charge of one party and Mr. Damon of
another. Garret Jackson and his assistant took
command of the two remaining squads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And bless my fountain pen!” exclaimed Mr.
Damon as they were talking matters over on
their way home in Tom’s boat, “I thought you
were never going to flash the signals, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It took a little time to get things where I
wanted them,” the young inventor said. “But
it worked out all right. They certainly were
astonished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think they’ll play square with you,
Tom?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll have to, for their own safety. I’ve
got them where they can’t help themselves.
After the final demonstration, a week from to-night,
we get the three millions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose there is no doubt, Tom, as to the
success of the thing?” ventured Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the slightest!” Tom’s voice was full
of confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grumblings and growlings were heard issuing
from the throat of Koku. Tom asked what the
trouble was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s complaining because there was no
fight!” chuckled Mr. Damon. “He says Ned
promised him that he could get hold of some of
your enemies, Tom, but it all fizzled out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me want smash um!” growled the giant,
clenching his big fists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad!” chuckled Tom. “But I couldn’t
pull off the fight, Koku. Better luck next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom made his motorboat fast to his own private
dock and went home to tell his father the
good news—that all matters were satisfactorily
settled. He knew the aged inventor would be
worried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you’re back, Tom,” Mr. Swift said
when he saw his son. “Now you can take it
easy. You’ve been working too hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hard work isn’t over yet,” the young inventor
answered. “I still have to give a perfect
final test.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this end he and Ned and the workmen bent
all their energies during the next six days. Mr.
Swift aided where he could and Mr. Damon was
again called on to do his funny song and dance.
Now that the invention was about to be made
public and Tom had no fear about his patents
being stolen from him, the affair could be openly
talked about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to ask us to the dress rehearsal?”
inquired Mary, when Tom was spending
an evening with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better than that—I want you to be in it,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you and Helen. I want to see how
ladies’ garments will be shown on the screen.
Ned and Mr. Damon balk at becoming female
impersonators. Will you help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delighted! Oh, Tom, I do hope it will be a
success!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night of the final test came at last. Several
changes had been made both in the projecting
machine and in the broadcasting studio
since Tom’s last attempt to show talking pictures.
He had put a metallic curtain with reflecting
mirrors in the room where Mr. Damon
and Ned had done their part and the results were
better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though some day, Ned,” Tom said to his
chum, after a preliminary test, “I’ll show these
images without the use of any screen at all.
I’ll pick the electric impulses right out of
the air just as wireless sound waves come
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will mean you can broadcast from
any theater without the use of this sort of curtain,”
Ned remarked, pointing to the one in the
broadcasting room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. All that will be needed in the
theater will be a small cabinet, out of sight, on
the stage. But more of that later. Now we’ll
go ahead with the test.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moving picture and theatrical men, representing
the syndicate that had bought a half
interest in Tom’s invention, were on hand in the
studio. They had brought with them some experts
who were to pass on certain phases of the
machine. Mr. Damon, with Ned and the two
girls were in the studio. Tom Swift, with Mr.
Jackson and some men to assist him, was busy
at the projecting machine by means of which the
audience hoped to hear the distant music and see
the performers through several solid walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All ready, Ned?” Tom asked over the private
telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All set,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then get going!” ordered Tom in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned the switch for the final test, knowing
that a great deal depended on it. Those
three million dollars were sorely needed to save
the Swift fortunes.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2  id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>A BRIGHT FUTURE</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> was a hissing, buzzing sound in the
studio where, on an improvised stage, Ned, Mr.
Damon, Mary Nestor and Helen Morton were
going through a hastily sketched act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift had so improved his lighting arrangements,
by using screen filters, that there
was no restriction as to the color of the garments
worn by the performers. The girls’ dresses were
particularly gay and of many hues, for Tom
wanted a bright picture on the screen. Mr. Damon
had attired himself as a clown while Ned
was a pirate with a red handkerchief on his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a pirate’s life for me!” sang Ned, and so
on with the rest of the song while the girls and
Mr. Damon joined in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his part, in the laboratory room, Tom had
adjusted the switches and stood near his machine.
Ranged in a semicircle in front of him
was the audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything is ready, gentlemen,” said the
young inventor in a low voice. “You will now
see and hear what I have to offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, through the loud speaker, came the
voices of the performers, as clear and distinct
as though they were in the same room. There
was no blasting effect, no tinny, horn-like element
in the music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later the metallic glass screen attached
to the apparatus glowed with a white
light and before the eyes of the astonished gathering
there appeared, in reduced form, but
plainly and clearly, the images of the performers
in a room several hundred feet away. Just
as on a moving picture screen, only not as large,
but beautifully colored and clearer than ever
moving pictures had been, the images of Mary,
Helen, Mr. Damon and Ned were observed.
They smiled, gestured and went through various
motions, not one of which was obscured
and not one but synchronized exactly with the
words they used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my invention,” said Tom Swift simply.
“If you think it is a success we can complete
the deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess there’s no question of it,” said
Mr. X. “I, for one, am satisfied and as soon
as——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ceased speaking, for suddenly, in the
midst of a song by the performers in the studio,
the voices died away and the images faded from
the screen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t cut it off!” begged Mr. B. “I was just
beginning to enjoy it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t cut it off!” Tom answered quickly.
“There’s something wrong!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, from the corridor without, the voice
of Koku was heard crying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cotch him! I got him! Now I make him
like jelly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like an echo came a frightened voice begging:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go! Oh, let me go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Greenbaum!” shouted Tom, springing to the
door in time to see the giant holding the plotting
man in a grasp that made him helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cotch him!” cried Koku. “I be on watch
out here like Mr. Tom always tell me. I see
him sneak along and cut wire. He have big
ball in his hand, too, but I knock it down.
Over there in corner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Garret Jackson made a jump for the corner
indicated and picked up something which made
him utter an exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a bomb!” the superintendent shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pail of water near by and into
that the infernal machine was dropped just in
time, for the fuse was spluttering and burning
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Greenbaum, choked into senselessness by
Koku’s powerful grip, sank to the floor. Tom
turned to the assembled moving picture and
theater men. There was an implied accusation
in his glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you will believe us when I say we had
absolutely nothing to do with this,” said Mr.
X. “We have not seen Greenbaum since his
former unauthorized attack on you. This is a
terrible surprise to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to me, also,” said Tom. “I don’t know
what damage he has done, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He not do much!” chuckled Koku. “Me
cotch him in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it proved. Greenbaum had managed
to sneak into the laboratory because vigilance
was somewhat relaxed, now that all danger
seemed over. He had cut one of the electrical
wires that carried power to Tom’s machine, hoping,
in the confusion he knew would follow, to
be able to plant his infernal machine and get
away. But the giant was too quick for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the machine ruined?” asked Ned, coming
from the broadcasting studio, followed by the
other performers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my apple pie! And just when I was
going to sing my song!” complained Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a quick examination showed nothing
more wrong than a severed wire, which was
soon spliced, so that the machine could work
again, and after Greenbaum had been handed
over to the police, first needing the attention of
a doctor, however, the interrupted performance
went on to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the little playlet was ended, and the
men engaged by Mr. X and his colleagues had
made their report, the leader of the theatrical
interests announced:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are satisfied, Mr. Swift. The deal can
go through. You will be paid the three million
to-morrow and we will at once form a company
for manufacturing these machines and put them
on the market. But I am afraid you still feel
that we sent Greenbaum here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Tom answered, “I have good reasons
for knowing you did not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What reasons?” asked Mr. X in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because the man is insane. The doctor told
me so just before he was taken away. You told
me his losses in a moving picture deal had so
turned his brain that he did more than you
wanted him to when you first set him to spy on
me. Well, his insanity is of a progressive form,
and he is much worse now. He probably imagined
that I was the cause of all his troubles,
and so came to be revenged on me. I know
you had nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you are convinced of that,” said
Mr. X. “And we have to thank you for treating
us even better than, perhaps, we deserved.
But from now on we will work in harmony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This promise was faithfully kept. Much to
Ned Newton’s relief the sum of three millions
was placed to the credit of the Swift concern
the next day, and certain maturing notes were
taken up. There was a goodly capital left,
however, to start the manufacture of the talking-picture
machines and they were soon put on
the market, meeting with a big success. The
radio and moving picture people, as well as several
big theatrical interests, bought stock in the
new company that was formed, and because of
Tom’s invention, by means of which only authorized
purchasers of his machine could view
the broadcast scenes and listen to the music,
there was no “bootlegging,” which meant that
all the revenues would come to those entitled to
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was glad to learn, later, that Greenbaum’s
insanity was not permanent, and that
after the man was assured of a chance to make
another fortune in the new business, his mind
became calm and he was himself again. He
was totally unaware of the outrages he had committed,
though when told of them asked Tom’s
forgiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snogg, Janner and Torpy were not heard of
again, and the house on Rattlesnake Island,
which was the property of the moving picture
men, was made over to Tom as a sort of bonus.
He and Ned spent many hours there, relaxing
from their hard work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after Greenbaum’s recovery, when certain
things were recalled to him, that he explained
what for a time had puzzled Ned and
Tom. The man, who was an expert electrician,
had found a means of neutralizing certain parts
of the electrified fence. Hence he was able to
get over, after the discovery of the planted
bombs, to commit petty depredations that so
annoyed Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Greenbaum, also, who provided the
fash melon that had thrown Koku off his guard.
As Tom had guessed, the fruit was discovered in
South America by a party of travelogue movie
men who brought some back with them. Greenbaum,
learning of Koku’s fondness for fash,
used it to play what was nearly a fatal trick on
the giant. Greenbaum had also been responsible
for the “warning” Eradicate brought to
Tom. That was just a bluff—intended to scare
Tom, but it worked the other way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The secret passage in the house on Rattlesnake
Island was easily accounted for. The
place had been built some years before to be
used in making a certain moving picture, where
a secret staircase played a part. Later the
house was acquired by Mr. X and his colleagues
to use as a prison and also as a meeting place
for Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom suitably rewarded Bill Tagg, the tramp,
and that individual had his long ardent wish
fulfilled. He rode in one of Tom’s aeroplanes
and received the thrill of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, everything came out all right, didn’t
it?” asked Ned of his chum as they sat in the
house on Rattlesnake Island one evening after
a successful day’s fishing. “Your talking pictures
are making a hit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They seem to be,” admitted Tom modestly.
“Though when Greenbaum cut the wire that
night of the final test I thought everything had
gone bad. But, as you say, everything came
out all right, and the future looks rosy to me.
I’ve got another scheme in my mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you ever going to stop?” chuckled
Ned as he leaned lazily back in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not as long as I feel as well as I do now,”
replied Tom Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether he carried out his new idea or not
remains to be seen.</p>
